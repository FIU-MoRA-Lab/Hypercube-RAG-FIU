We need to figure out a way to fix it and make it work.\" Part of what made the Green Revolution so revolutionary was the invention of synthetic, nitrogen-heavy fertilizers that could keep agricultural yields high. But they're expensive to make, they create an enormous amount of carbon dioxide, and much of the fertilizer washes away. Most crops only use about 40-60% of the nitrogen applied to them, a measurement known as nitrogen use efficiency, or NUE, and the NUE of rice can be as low as 30% -- which means that 70% of what a farmer puts on their fields washes away into streams, lakes and the oceans, causing eutrophication, dead zones and a host of other environmental problems. It also means that 70% of the cost of the fertilizer is likewise wasted. Furthermore, when nitrogen is applied to soils, it interacts with the soil's incredibly complex chemistry and microbes, and ultimately leads to vastly increased amounts of methane, ammonia and nitrous oxide -- all of which contribute to global warming. Furthermore, synthesizing fertilizer itself is a greenhouse-gas-heavy enterprise. \"Everybody knows that we need to improve NUE,\" says Xing -- the question is how? What Xing and his co-authors, including lead author Chuanxi Wang and another senior author, Zhenyu Wang, professors of environmental processes and pollution control at Jiangnan University discovered, is that nanoscale selenium, an element crucial for plant and human health, when applied to the foliage and stems of the rice, reduced the negative environmental impacts of nitrogen fertilization by 41% and increased the economic benefits by 38.2% per ton of rice, relative to conventional practices. \"We used an aerial drone to lightly spray rice growing in a paddy with the suspension of nanoscale selenium,\" says Wang. \"That direct contact means that the rice plant is far more efficient at absorbing the selenium than it would be if we applied it to the soil.\" Selenium stimulates the plant's photosynthesis, which increased by more than 40%. Increased photosynthesis means the plant absorbs more CO 2 , which it then turns into carbohydrates. Those carbohydrates flow down into the plant's roots, which causes them to grow. Bigger, healthier roots release a host of organic compounds that cultivate beneficial microbes in the soil, and it's these microbes that then work symbiotically with the rice roots to pull more nitrogen and ammonium out of the soil and into the plant, increasing its NUE from 30 to 48.3%, decreasing the amount of nitrous oxide and ammonia release to the atmosphere by 18.8-45.6%. With more nutrients coming in, the rice itself produces a higher yield, with a more nutritious grain: levels of protein, certain critical amino acids, and selenium also jumped. On top of all of this, Xing, Wang and their colleagues found that their nano-selenium applications allowed farmers to reduce their nitrogen applications by 30%. Since rice cultivation accounts for 15-20% of the global nitrogen use, this new technique holds real promise for helping to meet the triple threat of growing population, climate change, and the rising economic and environmental costs of agriculture."

    "context": "[DOC 2015]\nThe new study was led by experts at Newcastle University and the Met Office and investigated how future climate change may influence compound wind-rain extremes, which are events where extreme wind and rainfall occur simultaneously. The researchers analysed data from climate simulations covering control (1981-2000) and future (2060-2081) periods, to assess potential changes in these extreme events. Their findings show that, as the climate warms, these events are likely to become more severe, with stronger winds and heavier rainfall happening together. These changes are mainly driven by increased rainfall, a thermodynamic response to rising temperatures. Additional contributing factors include a strengthened jet stream and its southward displacement that brings storms through warmer areas leading to further increases in rainfall. Publishing their findings in the journal Weather and Climate Extremes, the scientists show that the increase in intensity could lead to more frequent windstorms coinciding with extreme rainfall and floods, posing challenges to coastal areas susceptible to compound flooding as well as emergency response resources due to larger aggregation of separate impacts to infrastructure such as electricity networks and rail transport networks. Study lead author, Dr Colin Manning, Research Associate at Newcastle University's School of Engineering and Visiting Scientist, Met Office, Hadley Centre, said: \"Our work shows that such compound extremes will occur more frequently as our climate warms and likely bring more severe impacts, and a higher aggregation of separate damages arising from wind and flooding which may stretch emergency response resources. Avoiding the worst of these impacts will require cutting our greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the resilience of our infrastructure.\" The team used a number of methods to analyse compound wind-rain extremes and their future changes. They used an event-based analysis based on the occurrence of an extra-tropical cyclone (ETC) over the UK and Ireland. By linking extreme wind and rainfall events to these systems, the scientists assessed their severity using Wind Severity Index (WSI) and Rainfall Severity Index (RSI). Return periods (RPs) were estimated for both individual and joint extremes, indicating their likelihood, while the team categorised events based on their wind and rainfall characteristics. In addition, the researchers identified local co-occurrences of extreme wind gusts and rainfall to understand their changing intensity contributions in future simulations. Professor Lizzie Kendon, Head of Understanding Climate Change at the Met Office and co-author on the paper, said: \"This work exploits the latest high resolution climate projections for the UK, UKCP Local, where the Met Office weather forecast model has been run to give 100-y long climate projections at km-scale. These are providing new insights into how the UK climate may change at the very local scale, and how changes in weather extremes may be realised over the coming years and decades. This is highlighting the importance of considering compounding effects, including co-occurrences of different hazards, as well as the clustering of extreme events, in fully capturing the potential impacts of climate change.\" This research sets the stage for further investigation into the mechanisms driving compound wind-rain extremes. Future research will need to consider a greater range of climate models to understand if the results are robust across different models. Research is also required to understand and quantify the link between these compound extremes and the resultant impacts which would help stakeholders better understand their risk and choose the most cost-effective adaptations to reduce risks. The research was supported and funded by UKRI NERC funded STORMY-WEATHER project (NE/V004166/1)."

In the study, civil unrest is classified as over 30,000 people in the UK suffering violent injury in one year through events such as demonstrations and violent looting. Just over 40% of the food experts surveyed believe that civil unrest in the UK in the next 10 years was either possible (38%) or more likely than not (3%). Over the next 50 years, this increased to nearly 80% of experts believing civil unrest was either possible (45%), more likely than not (24%), or very likely (10%). The participants were then asked, if disruption to the food system was to cause the unrest, was it likely to be due to not enough food being available overall, or problems with food distribution, preventing it getting to the right places and creating isolated pockets of hunger. They were asked to consider both questions over the two time frames, 10 and 50 years. The results show that 80% of experts believe logistical distribution issues leading to shortages are the most likely food-related cause of civil unrest in the next 10 years. But, considered over a 50-year horizon, they said catastrophic failure resulting in insufficient food to feed the UK population, rather than distribution problems, would be the most likely cause. The 58 experts who took part in the research were then asked to rank the possible causes of food shortages, and the foods most likely to provoke civil unrest. Wheat, bread, pasta and cereal are thought to be the types of food most likely to lead to unrest, while extreme weather -- including storm surges, flooding, snow and drought -- was chosen as the most likely cause of food shortages and food distribution issues over both the 10-year and 50-year time frames. However, rather than one single driver (extreme weather), the food experts felt that a combination of factors -- including ecological collapse, trade restrictions, a financial crash, rogue AI, a new pandemic, and animal or plant pathogens -- was most likely. Currently just under 50% of the UK's food is imported including 80% of fruit, 50% of vegetables, and 20% of beef and poultry, while the UK is almost completely self-sufficient for wheat, barley, lamb, and potatoes. Around 85% of food imports arrive via boat, and once in the UK, 98% of all food is transported by road. The researchers' aim is to highlight the potential vulnerability of the food system and the importance of developing plans to prepare and respond to these risks. They say the food system has been optimised for efficiency rather than resilience and faces major challenges in the future -- from not just climate change, but a combination of factors that increase the level of risk. Professor Sarah Bridle, Chair of Food, Climate and Society at the University of York, said: \"Covid 19, Brexit and the cost of living crisis have shown the UK is already exposed to certain risks. The food system faces significant challenges. We are experiencing an increasing number of extreme weather events, many driven by climate change. It is entirely possible that in the coming decades extreme weather will cause major crop yield failures across multiple breadbaskets. We need a food system designed not just for optimal efficiency, but also for resilience.\" Professor Aled Jones, Director of the Global Sustainability Institute at Anglia Ruskin University, and also lead author, said: \"By mapping out the potential risks, and their possible causes, we hope this report will assist with the preparations needed to avoid a UK food system catastrophe. \"Government agencies as well as business, must explore and fund options to increase the resilience of the food system including ecosystem restoration and management, storage and distribution, working conditions, sustainable farming practices, consumer engagement, as well as tackling food poverty and mitigating climate change. The Covid pandemic saw major disruption to food distribution and consumption from which lessons need to be learnt.\" Sue Newton, GB Food & Beverage Leader at WTW, said: \"In an increasingly connected world it has never been more important for businesses to think beyond single risks and solutions. Governments and businesses need to be ready for multiple scenarios, reactive when the exact situation doesn't unfold as scripted, and aware of the art of the possible. This research supports organisations in understanding the various pathways that might unfold to feed into their risk planning, and build resilience by identifying needs to support prevention, preparedness, response and recovery planning.\""

    "context": "[DOC 2089]\nThe new technology, which is now integrated into a small, compact refrigerator prototype, is based on an incredibly simple principle: heat is removed from a space by stretching wires and releasing them again. Known as 'artificial muscles', the shape-memory wires made of super-elastic nitinol absorb heat in the cooling chamber and release it to the outer environment. 'Our elastocaloric process enables us to achieve temperature differences of around 20 degrees Celsius without using climate-damaging refrigerants in a far more energy-efficient manner than today's conventional technologies,' explains Professor Stefan Seelecke, who conducts research at Saarland University and the SaarbrÃ¼cken Center for Mechatronics and Automation Technology (ZeMa). The efficiency of elastocaloric materials is more than ten times that of today's air conditioning systems or refrigerators. The U.S. Department of Energy and the EU Commission have declared the cooling technology developed in SaarbrÃ¼cken to be the most promising alternative to existing processes. It can extract heat from much larger spaces than the small cooling chamber which the engineers are now using to demonstrate elastocalorics at the Hannover Messe. And it can also supply heat to much larger spaces. Heat transfer via the superelastic wires also works for heating applications. In view of climate change, energy shortages and the growing demand for cooling and heating, the process represents a highly promising solution for the future. To transport heat, the researchers use the special 'superpower' of the artificial muscles made of nitinol: shape memory. Wires made of this alloy remember their original shape and revert to it after they have been deformed or stretched. Like muscles flexing, they can become long and then short again, and are also able to tense and relax. The reason for this lies deep inside the nitinol, which has two crystal lattices -- two phases that can transform into each other. Unlike water, whose phases are solid, liquid and gaseous, the two phases of nitinol are both solid. During these phase transitions of the crystalline structure, the wires absorb heat and release it again: 'The shape-memory material releases heat when it is stretched in a superelastic state and absorbs heat when it is released,' explains Professor Paul Motzki, who holds a cross-institutional professorship at Saarland University and ZeMa, where he heads the Smart Material Systems research group. The effect is intensified if numerous wires are bundled together -- due to their larger surface area, they absorb and release more heat. Although the principle may at first seem very simple, the research questions that need to be addressed to construct a cooling circuit are highly complex. In the mini-fridge that the research team is currently presenting in Hanover, a specially designed, patented cam drive continuously rotates bundles of 200 micron-thin nitinol wires around a circular cooling chamber: 'As they move in a circle, they are mechanically loaded on one side, i.e. stretched, and unloaded on the other,' explains PhD student Lukas Ehl, who is working on the cooling system. Air is channelled past the rotating bundles into the cooling chamber, where the wires are unloaded and absorb heat from the air. The air then circulates continuously around unloaded wires in the cooling chamber. As they continue to rotate, the wires transport heat out of the cooling chamber and release it when stretched outside the cooling chamber. 'The cooling chamber cools to around 10-12 degrees Celsius using this method,' says student Nicolas Scherer, who is conducting research in the project as part of his Master's thesis. The engineers in SaarbrÃ¼cken are researching how the drive keeps the wires permanently in motion, what the air flows look like, in what way the processes are most efficient, how many wires they need to bundle, how strongly they should ideally be stretched for a certain cooling level and much more. They have also developed software that enables them to adjust the heating and cooling technology for different applications and to simulate and plan cooling systems. And they are researching the entire cycle from material production and recycling through to production. Refrigerators are only just the start. 'We want to leverage the innovative potential of elastocalorics in a wide range of applications, such as industrial cooling, electric vehicle cooling to advance e-mobility and also household appliances,' explains Paul Motzki. The new technology is the result of over a decade of research in several million-euro research projects and multiple award-winning doctoral dissertation projects. Project funding has come in part from the EU and the German Research Foundation (DFG). The Federal Ministry of Education and Research is investing more than 17 million euros in the DEPART!Saar project, in which the researchers are collaborating with other research institutions and industrial partners. The aim is to give rise to new technology transfer formats and accelerate the path to the market. In several research projects and doctoral dissertation projects, the engineers have also developed a cooling and heating demonstrator that runs continuously and shows how elastocalorics can cool and heat air. At the Hannover Messe, the SaarbrÃ¼cken-based experts for smart material systems will also be demonstrating the versatility of their shape memory technology in the form of smart miniature drives, energy-efficient robotic grippers and soft robotic arms in the shape of elephant trunks."

Even a Danish military vessel which visited the fjord three days into the first seismic event did not observe the wave which was shaking the Earth. In the new study, the Oxford researchers used novel analysis techniques to interpret satellite altimetry data. This measures the height of the Earth's surface (including the ocean) by recording how long it takes for a radar pulse to travel from a satellite to the surface and back again. Up to now, conventional satellite altimeters were not able to capture evidence of the wave due to long gaps between observations, and the fact that they sample data directly beneath the spacecraft, producing 1D profiles along the sea-surface. This makes them incapable of depicting the differences in water height needed to spot the waves. This study used data captured by the new Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite, launched in December 2022 to map the height of water across 90% of Earth's surface. At the heart of SWOT is the cutting-edge Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) instrument, which uses two antennas mounted on a 10-meter boom on either side of the satellite. These two antennas work together to triangulate the return signals that bounce back from the radar pulse -- enabling them to measure ocean and surface water levels with unprecedented accuracy (up to 2.5 meters resolution) along a swath 30 miles (50 kilometers) wide. Using KaRIn data, the researchers made elevation maps of the Greenland Fjord at various time points following the two tsunamis. These showed clear, cross-channel slopes with height differences of up to two metres. Crucially, the slopes in these maps occurred in opposite directions, showing that water moved backwards and forwards across the channel. To prove their theory, the researchers linked these observations to small movements of the Earth's crust measured thousands of kilometres away. This connection enabled them to reconstruct the characteristics of the wave, even for periods which the satellite did not observe. The researchers also reconstructed weather and tidal conditions to confirm that the observations could not have been caused by winds or tides. Lead author Thomas Monahan (DPhil student, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford) said: \"Climate change is giving rise to new, unseen extremes. These extremes are changing the fastest in remote areas, such as the Arctic, where our ability to measure them using physical sensors is limited. This study shows how we can leverage the next generation of satellite earth observation technologies to study these processes.\" \"SWOT is a game changer for studying oceanic processes in regions such as fjords which previous satellites struggled to see into.\" Co-author Professor Thomas Adcock (Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford) said: \"This study is an example of how the next generation of satellite data can resolve phenomena that has remained a mystery in the past. We will be able to get new insights into ocean extremes such as tsunamis, storm surges, and freak waves. However, to get the most out of these data we will need to innovate and use both machine learning and our knowledge of ocean physics to interpret our new results.\""

While climate change is a global problem, other important risk factors like land subsidence, population density and ineffective governance are local problems. Risks to deltas will only increase over time, so now is the time for governments to take action,\" says Murray Scown, associate senior lecturer, Lund University Centre for Sustainability Studies, and lead author. Collapse of delta environments could have huge consequences for global sustainable development. In the worst-case scenario, deltas could be lost to the sea; other consequences are flooding, salinization of water, which affects agriculture, coastal squeeze, and loss of ecosystems. The study, published in Global Environmental Change, looked at five different IPCC scenarios for global development in 49 deltas all over the world, including famous deltas such as the Nile, Mekong, and Mississippi, but also more understudied deltas such as the Volta, Zambezi and Irrawaddy deltas. The research identifies possible risks to deltas stretching 80 years into the future. The researchers based their analysis on 13 well-known factors affecting risk in deltas and drew upon unique models to identify which of these risks are most likely to endanger different deltas in the future. Risk factors include increasing population density, urban development, irrigated agriculture, changes to river discharge, land subsidence and relative sea-level rise, limited economic capacity, poor government effectiveness, and low adaptation readiness. Population density, land subsidence and ineffective governance are high risk factors The analysis shows that there are some risks that are more critical to deltas than others -- in all of the five future scenarios. These include land subsidence and relative sea-level rise, population density, ineffective governance, economic capacity, and crop land use. For some deltas, physical risks are especially pronounced. Land subsidence is, for example, the highest risk factor for the Mekong delta in Vietnam. Extreme sea levels are among the most concerning risk factors for deltas in China, on the Korean peninsula, and in the Colorado (Mexico) and Rhine (Netherlands) deltas. In the Nile (Egypt), Niger (Nigeria), and the Ganges (Bangladesh) deltas, it is increasing population density that is of most concern under certain scenarios. For other deltas, it is the lack of economic capacity and government effectiveness to manage risks, for example in the Irrawaddy (Myanmar) and Congo (Angola and Democratic Republic of the Congo) deltas. \"Analysed all together, we can see that the Asian mega-deltas are at greatest risk, with potentially devastating consequences for millions of people, and for the environment. They are under pressure from population growth, intense agricultural land use, relative sea-level rise, and lagging adaptation readiness,\" says Murray Scown. Local and global approaches and a mixture of hard and soft adaptation can mitigate risks \"Instead of sitting back, governments need to think long-term, and put plans in place to reduce or mitigate risks. In the Mekong delta, for example, the Vietnamese government are making strong efforts to restrict future groundwater extraction in the delta to reduce land subsidence and salinization,\" says Philip Minderhoud, assistant professor at Wageningen University and Research. The researchers highlight that a mixture of hard (\"grey\") and soft (\"green\") adaptation approaches will be required to manage and mitigate delta risks. They include both hard infrastructures, like sea walls to stop the sea inundating the delta, and soft approaches using nature-based solutions. One example is the Dutch experience of creating room for the river in the Rhine delta, by lowering floodplains, relocating levees, and using spaces that are allowed to flood for grazing. Initiatives to build up delta surfaces by allowing rivers to flood and deposit sediment on the delta to maintain elevation above sea level are also promising, notes Frances Dunn, assistant professor at Utrecht University. \"By looking at the deltas together, like we have in this study, we want to highlight what can happen on a global scale if we do not address delta risk both on a local and global level. The study can also complement studies on individual deltas, and identify efforts needed connected to less studied deltas such as the SaÃµ Francisco or Volta delta,\" says Maria Santos, professor at the University of Zurich."

This tar easily clogs pipelines, damages equipment, and poses environmental risks if released into the atmosphere. For decades, researchers have sought ways to eliminate or neutralize it. Now, a team led by scientists at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences argues that instead of being treated as waste, bio-tar can be converted into \"bio-carbon\" -- a novel material with applications ranging from water purification to clean energy storage. \"Our review highlights how turning bio-tar into bio-carbon not only solves a technical problem for the bioenergy industry, but also opens the door to producing advanced carbon materials with high economic value,\" said senior author Dr. Zonglu Yao. The review examines how chemical reactions inside bio-tar, particularly those involving oxygen-rich compounds like carbonyls and furans, naturally promote polymerization -- processes where small molecules link together to form larger, more stable carbon structures. By carefully adjusting temperature, reaction time, and additives, researchers can harness this process to produce bio-carbon with tailored properties. The resulting material, the authors note, is distinct from ordinary biochar. Bio-carbon typically has higher carbon content, lower ash, and unique structural features that make it especially suited for advanced uses. Early studies suggest that bio-carbon could serve as: Importantly, recent economic and life-cycle assessments suggest that converting bio-tar into bio-carbon can deliver net-positive energy, financial, and environmental benefits. For example, replacing coal with bio-carbon fuels could cut carbon dioxide emissions by hundreds of millions of tons annually, while also generating profits for biomass processing plants. Still, challenges remain. The chemical complexity of bio-tar makes it difficult to fully control the polymerization process, and large-scale production has not yet been achieved. The authors recommend combining laboratory experiments with computer simulations and machine learning to optimize reaction pathways and design bio-carbon with specific functions. \"Bio-tar polymerization is not just about waste treatment -- it represents a new frontier for creating sustainable carbon materials,\" said first author Yuxuan Sun. \"With further research, this approach could significantly improve the efficiency of biomass energy systems while providing new tools for environmental protection and clean technology.\" The study provides a roadmap for scientists and industry partners to turn one of bioenergy's biggest obstacles into a powerful resource for the future."

However, there has to be a way to navigate the uncertainty: we don't want to be too brash, but we also cannot wait 50 years to determine what to do either.\" In making recommendations for future phosphorus use, researchers can measure how much was added to the soil and how much was exported by biomass removal (e.g., harvest) or loss (e.g., leaching or erosion). Calculating the balance (what went in, minus what came out of a 'system' like a field, watershed or country) enables estimation of the quantify of residual P -- a positive mass balance. The position paper also provide several case studies of legacy P using the two oldest continuous agriculture test plots in the World, the Rothamsted Experiment in Harpenden, England founded in 1843, and the University of Illinois Morrow Plots founded in 1876. Among the discoveries was that the accumulated phosphorus is generally located in the top 12 inches of the soil, and is often in a different form than when it was added to the soil. This last part was a key finding of the paper. \"We typically add phosphorus in inorganic form as phosphate, which is readily soluble in in water and thus may be at a high risk for loss,\" explains Margenot. \"What we found is that even though we have a lot of phosphorus going on as phosphate, the amount that builds up doesn't persist in soil in the soluble phosphate form. It transforms into forms associated with organic matter, iron, and calcium. So we can't assume that the amount of phosphorus that was applied and not used (i.e., residual phosphorus), is there for the taking by the crop or potential loss to water.\" In addition to comprehensively evaluating the problem, the consortium made several recommendations. 1) Researchers need to be better at validating estimates. \"Oftentimes we don't measure the small input or the output amounts of phosphorus. Over time those gaps in the measurements amplify uncertainty,\" Margenot says. 2) Scientists often don't have sufficient information to form decent estimates.The group suggests an initiative where the private sector (e.g., soil testing labs) could work with researchers to make use of existing datasets. 3) There needs to be a uniform method of measuring the data. \"In a lot of cases, basic measurements basically haven't been taken,\" Margenot says. \"We need to couple complementary methods that are individually not great, but in combination are quite strong. While it can be overwhelming to figure out where the P has built up over the last 70 years, I think the important thing is to identify where it matters for different reasons of agronomic utilization and water quality impairment.\" 4) There needs to be an effort to discover the hot spots of legacy P so that resources could be prioritized to decrease the negative impacts of water quality. Margenot's group is already doing that in Illinois. \"We don't need to map the entire state,\" Margenot says. \"We know where there is a priority watershed because the USGS is measuring this.\" The challenge according to the paper is to convince researchers and funders to allocate resources to provide data that will make a difference. \"To get that last 5 percent of the data will cost you half of what it takes for other 95% of the data,\" Margenot notes. The challenge for policymakers, according to Margenot, will be to explain that because the measurements of legacy P are estimates at this point, they should see the data as a living document. \"The policies have to be plastic,\" he says. \"The global phosphorus has been more perturbed by human activities than nitrogen,\" Margenot notes. \"We've about doubled the amount of nitrogen in circulation in the biosphere, but we have quadrupled it for phosphorus.\""

A new study led by researchers at the University of Portsmouth, in partnership with Dhaka University and Curtin University, sheds light on how rising oceans are pushing saltwater into freshwater rivers and underground water sources in the world's largest river mouth -- the Bengal Delta in Bangladesh. Drawing on nearly two decades of data from over 50 monitoring stations in coastal Bangladesh, the team tracked a consistent rise in salt levels in rivers and estuaries, particularly since the mid-2000s. The western parts of the delta, already more prone to tidal influence, showed the fastest increases in salinity. The data suggests that the combination of sea-level rise, reduced freshwater flow, and increasingly frequent storm surges are all contributing to the inland movement and retention of saltwater. Since around 2007, many parts of the delta have experienced stepwise increases in salinity, often linked to powerful storms like Cyclone Sidr. These changes can devastate crops, erode food security, and force communities to move. While the analysis focused primarily on environmental data, it underscores how salinity intrusion is increasingly a threat to livelihoods, public health, and regional stability. The study, published in Ecological Indicators , uses one of the most detailed and long-running salinity datasets in any delta system worldwide. It applied advanced statistical methods to distinguish long-term trends from short-term weather or seasonal changes.

This study helps us understand the mechanics behind it, and underscores the urgency for coordinated, global action.\" The findings also show the limits of relying only on land-based solutions. Human interventions like embankments, riverbed alterations, and upstream dams have often made things worse by restricting freshwater flows. Meanwhile, offshore dynamics -- such as sediment build-up and ocean current shifts -- play a larger role than previously appreciated. Addressing the problem, therefore, requires integrated approaches that connect rivers, oceans, and climate systems. Coastal regions in California, including Los Angeles County and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, are combating saltwater intrusion through innovative measures. In LA, freshwater is injected into aquifers to create hydraulic barriers against seawater. However, population growth and groundwater extraction continue to challenge these efforts. \"While the focus is on Bangladesh, the study's implications are global,\" said Dr Sean Feist, former PhD researcher at the University of Portsmouth and now Scientific Officer at Test Valley Borough Council. \"Coastal regions from the Mekong Delta in Vietnam to Louisiana's wetlands in the United States face similar pressures. As sea levels continue to rise, the risk of agricultural land turning salty, drinking water becoming undrinkable, and shallow groundwater becoming permanently brackish grows ever more serious.\" The paper recommends that similar long-term investigations into changing salinity levels be conducted in other vulnerable coastal regions around the world, particularly in low-lying deltas facing rising seas, reduced river flows, and increasing storm activity. Short-term datasets can often misrepresent the scale or pace of salinisation, while extended records offer a clearer picture of how saltwater intrusion evolves over time. Dr Ashraf Dewan from Curtin University said: \"Ultimately, this study highlights that the creeping salinisation of deltas is a slow-moving but deeply disruptive force.

In other areas, like the lower Po River basin near Ravenna, groundwater levels are even rising due to natural and anthropogenic factors and land subsidence, requiring surface water drainage and groundwater pumping to prevent flooding. In semi-arid regions, however, there are many places, such as Tarbes in France and Medina del Campo in Spain, where groundwater levels have been declining for decades. This is partly due to decreased rainfall and elevated temperatures brought about by climate change. Intensive agriculture is also a significant factor. \"These four Mediterranean countries are responsible for a large part of the EU's fruit, vegetable, and grain production, with groundwater supplying 30-50% of irrigation,\" says Seifeddine Jomaa. Even in temperate regions, the team found wells with declining groundwater levels. The cause is proximity to cities and industry. Since the 1960s, for example, groundwater levels in the metropolitan areas of cities such as Lyon, Nice, Modena, and Bordeaux have been declining. In Bordeaux, the ninth-largest city in France, the high groundwater consumption is attributed to increasing domestic use. The popular French tourist destination, BÃ©ziers, has seen a significant decline in groundwater levels due to increased extraction to supply drinking water for summer tourists. While groundwater decline in urban and industrial areas is not easily halted, the researchers found effective management approaches in semi-arid, agricultural regions, which lead to the recovery of groundwater levels, as seen in La Mancha Oriental in Spain. Until the 1990s, groundwater levels were declining due to excessive irrigation. \"As a result, sections of the JÃºcar River dried up in 1994 for the first time ever. This dramatic event prompted farmers to create a water user association that aimed to stop the decline in groundwater levels through a combination of monitoring, remote sensing, and individual water use plans. These measures effectively reversed groundwater level trends in the region,\" says coauthor J. Jaime GÃ³mez-HernÃ¡ndez, hydrogeologist at the Technical University of Valencia. Against the backdrop of climate change, southwestern Europe can provide lessons for groundwater management in Germany and other regions worldwide, especially as groundwater demand increases and aquifer recharge suffers due to climate change. \"Germany could benefit from the experience gained in southwestern Europe, how groundwater can be optimally used, which irrigation methods are more effective, how we enhance stakeholder engagement and what mistakes should be avoided in the future,\" says Seifeddine Jomaa. One thing is clear: Germany needs an anticipatory approach for sustainable groundwater use."

    "context": "[DOC 7204]\nIn the aftermath of a disaster, rapidly assessing damage is critical for rescue, recovery and emergency planning. Damage assessments are typically conducted through field reconnaissance deployments, which can be labor-intensive, costly and risky. Moreover, field-based emergency response assessments can be hindered by delays and other setbacks due to the severity of the damage and the inability to access the hardest hit areas. Using remote sensing technology, Florida Atlantic University researchers have developed a novel technique that provides rapid, high-resolution assessments of detailed damage after a hurricane. Using aerial imagery data and LiDAR, they identified the hardest-hit areas of Southwest Florida's Estero Island and estimated the extent of structural damage. Researchers also compared pre- and post-storm structural or morphological changes to the beach. The study is the first to apply an advanced multi-faceted approach that links damage assessment to post-storm change in the structure of barrier islands. Results of the study, published in the Journal of Marine Science and Engineering , identified a total of 2,427 structures on Estero Island that were impacted by Hurricane Ian, with 170 structures suffering extensive damage. A single store was the only structure in the study area classified as \"not affected.\" Using data from the Lee County tax appraiser, researchers estimated the total assessed value of the heavily damaged structures at more than $200 million. Overall, 734 buildings had 30 to 50 percent structural damage, the majority of which were single-family and multi-unit residences. Researchers identified 158 buildings that were severely damaged with partial or complete roof failure. The highest percentage of damaged structures occurred on the central and northern portions of the island, where most of the structures were single-family and multi-family residences. Most of the structures that experienced 0 to 30 percent damage were classified as low-rise condominiums (three stories or less), commercial shopping centers and stores. Among the \"severely damaged\" and \"destroyed\" structures were seven mobile home subdivisions. \"Employing this advanced technology of aerial imagery and airborne LiDAR enabled us to collect extensive data from Hurricane Ian's aftermath and analyze large-scale datasets rather quickly,\" said Tiffany Roberts Briggs, Ph.D., senior author, chair and an associate professor in the Department of Geosciences within FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. The 2,427 structures were built between 1963 to 2019. The buildings in the areas where less damage was observed were built between 1963 and 1981. Similarly, in the areas of heavy damage, the majority of the buildings were built between 1963 and 1981. The spatial distribution of ground elevation and year built indicated no apparent trends associated with these two variables. \"We found no correlation between the ground elevation or year built for the extent of damages in this analysis, which emphasizes the role of the extreme inundation and importance of other factors contributing to vulnerability,\" said Roberts Briggs. \"Results from our study can help improve disaster planning by developing new policies and guidelines for coastal development in some of the most vulnerable and storm-exposed areas.\" Areas associated with little to no damage were spatially clustered in the southern and central portion of the island, with most structures concentrated on the landward side of the barrier island. \"The southern portion of Estero Island contains multiple saltwater marshes,\" said Leanne Hauptman, first author and a Ph.D. student in FAU's Department of Geosciences. \"Because of these saltwater marshes, storm-wave energy may been substantially dissipated by friction by the time the waves reached the barrier interior, potentially lessening the impact on the structures in that area.\" Findings also showed substantial post-storm debris and sand deposition across the entire island, and a notable deposition of sediment across the roadways and on the backside of the barrier, which is not readily returned seaward to the beach under post-storm conditions. Ponding water also was found hundreds of meters inland near buildings and other structures, providing evidence of the extent of inundation resulting from the storm. \"Although our study focused on Estero Island, this new remote sensing approach is generalizable,\" said Diana Mitsova, Ph.D., corresponding author, chair and professor, FAU Department of Urban and Regional Planning within the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science and an affiliate professor, FAU Department of Geosciences. \"As this technology continues to advance and becomes more readily available, it will offer a broad range of high-resolution coverage that can help prioritize emergency response efforts immediately following catastrophic natural disasters and other events.\" For the study, analysis of beach morphology was conducted by creating profile graphs to visualize elevation changes over a continuous distance. To measure structural damage, researchers use LiDAR tools to extract building footprints and building heights pre- and post-storm. Building footprints were overlaid on the post-imagery to estimate the total number of damaged buildings as well as the level of damage to each structure."

The findings, available online now and slated to publish in the October issue of the journal Food Quality and Preference , suggest that making the meal slightly spicier led participants to eat less, consuming fewer calories. \"We know from previous studies that when people slow down, they eat significantly less,\" said Paige Cunningham, a postdoctoral researcher and lead author on the study who earned her doctorate in nutritional sciences from Penn State in 2023. \"We suspected that making a meal spicier might slow people down. We thought, let's test, under controlled experimental conditions in the lab, if adding a small amount of spice, but not so much that the meal is inedible, will make people eat slower and therefore eat less.\" The researchers found that increasing spiciness slightly using dried chili pepper slowed down eating and reduced the amount of food and energy consumed at a meal, all without negatively affecting the palatability of the dish. \"This points to added chilies as a potential strategy for reducing the risk of energy overconsumption,\" said John Hayes, Penn State professor of food science and corresponding author on the paper. \"While portion control wasn't the explicit goal of this study, our results suggest this might work. Next time you're looking to eat a little less, try adding a blast of chilies, as it may slow you down and help you eat less.\" The team conducted three related experiments in a total of 130 adults who were served one of two lunch meals -- beef chili or chicken tikka masala -- in one of two versions: mild or spicy. The spiciness level was controlled by carefully varying the ratio of hot versus sweet paprika added to the dishes to vary the heat while keeping chili flavor constant. The researchers then recorded participants on high-definition video while they ate their meals to monitor their eating behaviors. From the videos, Hayes' team measured the amount of food and water consumed, meal duration, eating speed of grams per minute, bite rate, bite size, and collected ratings on appetite, liking and spiciness before and after the meal. \"Formulating the recipes took a long time for the chicken tikka,\" Cunningham said. \"It took so many rounds of testing that my lab mates were sick of it. But science is about trial and error. I'd make a recipe, see how far I could push the spiciness, and we'd taste it. We did that until we reached a level where palatability was matched even when spiciness increased.\" The study suggests the reduction in intake is driven by changes in oral processing behaviors, she explained. Specifically, participants ate the spicier meals more slowly. She explained that a slower eating rate often means food is in the mouth longer, which can help signal fullness and lead to eating less. Other studies that slow eating rate by manipulating texture have shown similar effects, she said. \"What's critical here is that the reduction in intake occurred without negatively impacting how much participants liked the food,\" Hayes said. He added that water intake didn't differ significantly between spicy and mild meals, suggesting that one seemingly obvious explanation, that people drank more water and filled up faster, was not the primary reason people ate less. \"This is why we need to do empirical studies of behavior, because what you might intuitively expect is often not the case,\" he said. Hayes also noted that appetite ratings made before and after the meals were similar, suggesting participants still felt full after the spicy meal, despite eating less of it. Looking ahead, the team is now focused on understanding how oral burn can impact other eating behaviors, like snacking.

These conditions limit the opportunities. Now, a new study led by UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain has found that that climate change is further reducing the overall number of days and changing the times of year when prescribed fires can be safely used. Currently, scientists project warming of 2.0 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2060 -- a projection Swain called \"optimistic\" given the current trajectory of even greater warming. Still, these temperatures would reduce the number of days when weather and vegetation conditions favor prescribed fires by 17% on average across the Western U.S. Most reductions would come in spring and summer, when most prescribed burns are currently implemented. Yet in winter, the research projects a net 4% increase in the number of favorable days for prescribed fire. Paper co-author Kristen Shive, a UC Berkeley expert on forests, wildfires and prescribed fire, said specific burn prescriptions vary by location and vegetation type, but target temperatures commonly range from 50-70 degrees Fahrenheit with 10-20% relative humidity. Climate change will require the agencies responsible for prescribed burns to adjust, Swain said, because most personnel who prepare for and manage prescribed fires are seasonal workers whose jobs end by mid-autumn each year. Going forward, the use of prescribed fires will require changes in staff availability. \"Global warming will reduce the number of favorable days for prescribed fires throughout the American West, but winter in particular may emerge as an increasingly favorable time for prescribed burns if the relevant policy and staffing changes can be made,\" Swain said. The researchers also found regional variation in the changes. In California, for example, the changes are most pronounced in coastal and southern parts of the state, with many places losing a month of days suitable for prescribed fires each year. The northern parts of the Rocky Mountains, on the other hand, may see a modest increase in days when it's safe to use these fires. Yet not much will change in the short term, according to Swain. \"We're just not doing a lot of prescribed fire compared to what is needed, at scale, to really address the escalating wildfire crisis,\" he said. The study, published in Communications Earth and Environment , a Nature journal, included research from UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Merced and the Nature Conservancy. It focused on historical and projected climate conditions and vegetation dryness, comparing 1980-2020 with 2020-2060. The researchers did not address other factors important to the use of prescribed fire: impact on ecology, public policy considerations, effects of smoke on humans and wildlife, and availability of staff to do prescribed burns. As wildfires in the American West have dramatically increased for a variety of reasons -- including climate change, human development in fire-prone areas and aggressive fire suppression in the 20th century -- tools like prescribed fires will only become more critical. Anticipating future opportunities and limitations to the use of this tool enables agencies to plan ahead, particularly as regards the firefighting work force. \"This paper is giving us advanced warning,\" Shive said. \"Hopefully we can change policies to either extend those folks or create winter-specific crews.\""

They also found that these insecticides could affect organisms in the streams that are fed by those springs. The research was recently published in Science of the Total Environment , a peer-reviewed scientific journal. With the increased use of insecticides for agriculture and insect control in the past few decades, research has shown that consistent application of them can lead to contamination in water. This can have a negative impact on human health and pollinator insect species, such as bees and butterflies. A large portion of Minnesota's drinking water comes from groundwater. Looking at the levels of these specific insecticides can help water treatment plants determine what to monitor and filter. In this study, researchers looked at the levels of neonicotinoids in surface and groundwater across Minnesota, identifying factors that may affect the extent of contamination. The DNR was able to collect water samples from 15 springs and 75 unique wells from 13 counties in Minnesota over four years (2019-2022) allowing comparisons between urban and rural areas. The researchers not only collected an extensive amount of geographic locations, they also looked at the chemical levels at various depths. In testing the water samples, they found that natural springs are very susceptible to contamination from neonicotinoid insecticides. \"Oftentimes people think a natural spring has water that is safe to drink,\" said Bill Arnold, Distinguished McKnight University Professor & Joseph T. and Rose S. Ling Professor in the University of Minnesota's Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geo- Engineering. \"That's not necessarily true, it depends on how deep that water is sourced.\" There are multiple ways these types of chemicals can get into the environment. In addition to direct application, stormwater runoff and snow melt can contribute to these chemicals in ground and surface water. The researchers were able to map different classes of the insecticides across the state. \"This study is a key first step in identifying pollutants in the water, even in some unexpected places like natural springs,\" said Arnold. \"We use so many of these insecticides in Minnesota -- basically every corn and soybean seed is treated before planting -- and many of these chemicals can be purchased at a local hardware store for spraying fruit trees, flea and tick control for your pets, and eliminating bedbugs.\" While the researchers knew they would find traces of the insecticide in water, some of their study results were unexpected. \"We were surprised by the high levels of the chemical detected in the natural springs and in some cases the chemicals were observed at much deeper levels in wells than we expected going into this project,\" Arnold added. As a follow-up to the study, researchers are collaborating with county and state agencies to include these chemicals on water treatment monitoring lists and want to continue to educate watershed districts about these insecticides. The researchers will also work with the University of Minnesota's St. Anthony Falls Laboratory to improve stormwater treatment methods for urban environments, including the use of biofiltration to remove pollutants. In addition to Arnold, the team included University of Minnesota Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geo- Engineering retired adjunct associate professor Paul Capel, former research assistant Grant Goedjen, and John Barry from the DNR's Division of Ecological and Water Resources.

Scientists conducted their research from 2021 until 2023 when California was experiencing periods of drought followed by atmospheric rivers. They measured nitrate during both the growing seasons and the rainy seasons. Drought can leave more nitrogen in soil Previous studies have shown about 40% of nitrogen fertilizer used for vegetables isn't absorbed by the plants but remains in the soil. During droughts, crops don't use nitrogen efficiently, leading to excess nitrogen in the soil. This study found that if a drought is then followed by heavy rainfall, that sudden burst of water causes nitrate to seep in groundwater more quickly. The nitrate concentration in the shallow groundwater exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency maximum contaminant level of 10 milligrams per liter for drinking water. \"In California, we often say we swing between droughts and floods,\" said Kisekka. \"These extreme events that come with climate change are going to make the risk of these chemicals ending up in our drinking water much more severe.\" Groundwater is the primary source of drinking water for most of California's Central Valley. In some regions, such as the Tulare Lake Basin, nearly one-third of drinking and irrigation wells exceed the EPA's safe nitrate level. High nitrate levels in drinking water can increase health risks, especially for young children. It may also increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Need for real-time soil nitrate monitoring Central Valley farmers are required to report to the Regional Water Board how much nitrogen they applied to their field and how much was removed as part of the crop's yield. The study compared different ways of monitoring when nitrate from fertilizers seep into groundwater. Kisekka said the results highlight the need for affordable, real-time soil nitrate monitoring tools to help farmers manage fertilizer use efficiently. By using conservation practices that limit leftover nitrates in the crop's root zone after harvest, farmers can help reduce nitrate contamination in groundwater. This study's data will also help improve a model called SWAT, which is used to track nitrate seepage into groundwater across California's Central Valley. This effort is part of the Central Valley Water Board's program to regulate irrigated farmlands. Other UC Davis authors include Iael Raij Hoffman, Thomas Harter and Helen Dahlke.

A new study led by researchers at the University of Portsmouth, in partnership with Dhaka University and Curtin University, sheds light on how rising oceans are pushing saltwater into freshwater rivers and underground water sources in the world's largest river mouth -- the Bengal Delta in Bangladesh. Drawing on nearly two decades of data from over 50 monitoring stations in coastal Bangladesh, the team tracked a consistent rise in salt levels in rivers and estuaries, particularly since the mid-2000s. The western parts of the delta, already more prone to tidal influence, showed the fastest increases in salinity. The data suggests that the combination of sea-level rise, reduced freshwater flow, and increasingly frequent storm surges are all contributing to the inland movement and retention of saltwater. Since around 2007, many parts of the delta have experienced stepwise increases in salinity, often linked to powerful storms like Cyclone Sidr. These changes can devastate crops, erode food security, and force communities to move. While the analysis focused primarily on environmental data, it underscores how salinity intrusion is increasingly a threat to livelihoods, public health, and regional stability. The study, published in Ecological Indicators , uses one of the most detailed and long-running salinity datasets in any delta system worldwide. It applied advanced statistical methods to distinguish long-term trends from short-term weather or seasonal changes. The researchers introduced a new conceptual model called the Offshore Controlled Estuarine and Aquifer Nexus (OCEAN) framework, that highlights how offshore features like steep underwater slopes and restricted tidal flows can trap salt in low-lying coastal zones. Dr Mohammad Hoque from the University of Portsmouth's School of the Environment and Life Sciences: said: \"What we're seeing in the Bengal Delta is not just a local crisis, it's a signal of what's coming for low-lying coastal areas around the world. \"Salinity is rising faster and reaching farther inland than many people realise, and it's happening quietly with major consequences for water security, agriculture, and livelihoods. This study helps us understand the mechanics behind it, and underscores the urgency for coordinated, global action.\" The findings also show the limits of relying only on land-based solutions. Human interventions like embankments, riverbed alterations, and upstream dams have often made things worse by restricting freshwater flows. Meanwhile, offshore dynamics -- such as sediment build-up and ocean current shifts -- play a larger role than previously appreciated. Addressing the problem, therefore, requires integrated approaches that connect rivers, oceans, and climate systems. Coastal regions in California, including Los Angeles County and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, are combating saltwater intrusion through innovative measures. In LA, freshwater is injected into aquifers to create hydraulic barriers against seawater. However, population growth and groundwater extraction continue to challenge these efforts. \"While the focus is on Bangladesh, the study's implications are global,\" said Dr Sean Feist, former PhD researcher at the University of Portsmouth and now Scientific Officer at Test Valley Borough Council. \"Coastal regions from the Mekong Delta in Vietnam to Louisiana's wetlands in the United States face similar pressures. As sea levels continue to rise, the risk of agricultural land turning salty, drinking water becoming undrinkable, and shallow groundwater becoming permanently brackish grows ever more serious.\" The paper recommends that similar long-term investigations into changing salinity levels be conducted in other vulnerable coastal regions around the world, particularly in low-lying deltas facing rising seas, reduced river flows, and increasing storm activity. Short-term datasets can often misrepresent the scale or pace of salinisation, while extended records offer a clearer picture of how saltwater intrusion evolves over time. Dr Ashraf Dewan from Curtin University said: \"Ultimately, this study highlights that the creeping salinisation of deltas is a slow-moving but deeply disruptive force. Without urgent investment in salt-tolerant agriculture, better water storage, and strategic planning across entire river basins, the disruptive impacts of salinity are likely to intensify. The Bengal Delta is on the frontline of climate change, but it is not alone. The patterns observed here are emerging in many of the world's great coastal regions. What happens next depends on how quickly we respond.\""

This tar easily clogs pipelines, damages equipment, and poses environmental risks if released into the atmosphere. For decades, researchers have sought ways to eliminate or neutralize it. Now, a team led by scientists at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences argues that instead of being treated as waste, bio-tar can be converted into \"bio-carbon\" -- a novel material with applications ranging from water purification to clean energy storage. \"Our review highlights how turning bio-tar into bio-carbon not only solves a technical problem for the bioenergy industry, but also opens the door to producing advanced carbon materials with high economic value,\" said senior author Dr. Zonglu Yao. The review examines how chemical reactions inside bio-tar, particularly those involving oxygen-rich compounds like carbonyls and furans, naturally promote polymerization -- processes where small molecules link together to form larger, more stable carbon structures. By carefully adjusting temperature, reaction time, and additives, researchers can harness this process to produce bio-carbon with tailored properties. The resulting material, the authors note, is distinct from ordinary biochar. Bio-carbon typically has higher carbon content, lower ash, and unique structural features that make it especially suited for advanced uses. Early studies suggest that bio-carbon could serve as: Importantly, recent economic and life-cycle assessments suggest that converting bio-tar into bio-carbon can deliver net-positive energy, financial, and environmental benefits. For example, replacing coal with bio-carbon fuels could cut carbon dioxide emissions by hundreds of millions of tons annually, while also generating profits for biomass processing plants. Still, challenges remain. The chemical complexity of bio-tar makes it difficult to fully control the polymerization process, and large-scale production has not yet been achieved. The authors recommend combining laboratory experiments with computer simulations and machine learning to optimize reaction pathways and design bio-carbon with specific functions. \"Bio-tar polymerization is not just about waste treatment -- it represents a new frontier for creating sustainable carbon materials,\" said first author Yuxuan Sun. \"With further research, this approach could significantly improve the efficiency of biomass energy systems while providing new tools for environmental protection and clean technology.\" The study provides a roadmap for scientists and industry partners to turn one of bioenergy's biggest obstacles into a powerful resource for the future."

We need to figure out a way to fix it and make it work.\" Part of what made the Green Revolution so revolutionary was the invention of synthetic, nitrogen-heavy fertilizers that could keep agricultural yields high. But they're expensive to make, they create an enormous amount of carbon dioxide, and much of the fertilizer washes away. Most crops only use about 40-60% of the nitrogen applied to them, a measurement known as nitrogen use efficiency, or NUE, and the NUE of rice can be as low as 30% -- which means that 70% of what a farmer puts on their fields washes away into streams, lakes and the oceans, causing eutrophication, dead zones and a host of other environmental problems. It also means that 70% of the cost of the fertilizer is likewise wasted. Furthermore, when nitrogen is applied to soils, it interacts with the soil's incredibly complex chemistry and microbes, and ultimately leads to vastly increased amounts of methane, ammonia and nitrous oxide -- all of which contribute to global warming. Furthermore, synthesizing fertilizer itself is a greenhouse-gas-heavy enterprise. \"Everybody knows that we need to improve NUE,\" says Xing -- the question is how? What Xing and his co-authors, including lead author Chuanxi Wang and another senior author, Zhenyu Wang, professors of environmental processes and pollution control at Jiangnan University discovered, is that nanoscale selenium, an element crucial for plant and human health, when applied to the foliage and stems of the rice, reduced the negative environmental impacts of nitrogen fertilization by 41% and increased the economic benefits by 38.2% per ton of rice, relative to conventional practices. \"We used an aerial drone to lightly spray rice growing in a paddy with the suspension of nanoscale selenium,\" says Wang. \"That direct contact means that the rice plant is far more efficient at absorbing the selenium than it would be if we applied it to the soil.\" Selenium stimulates the plant's photosynthesis, which increased by more than 40%. Increased photosynthesis means the plant absorbs more CO 2 , which it then turns into carbohydrates. Those carbohydrates flow down into the plant's roots, which causes them to grow. Bigger, healthier roots release a host of organic compounds that cultivate beneficial microbes in the soil, and it's these microbes that then work symbiotically with the rice roots to pull more nitrogen and ammonium out of the soil and into the plant, increasing its NUE from 30 to 48.3%, decreasing the amount of nitrous oxide and ammonia release to the atmosphere by 18.8-45.6%. With more nutrients coming in, the rice itself produces a higher yield, with a more nutritious grain: levels of protein, certain critical amino acids, and selenium also jumped. On top of all of this, Xing, Wang and their colleagues found that their nano-selenium applications allowed farmers to reduce their nitrogen applications by 30%. Since rice cultivation accounts for 15-20% of the global nitrogen use, this new technique holds real promise for helping to meet the triple threat of growing population, climate change, and the rising economic and environmental costs of agriculture."

Their proposed method avoids delaying the obligation to reduce emissions and calculates the immediate ambition gap that can be filled by climate measures and international finance. As negotiated climate targets are still insufficient, this work underscores the growing role of courts in ensuring that climate and human rights obligations are met. The study highlights that high-emitting countries, most notably G7 countries, Russia, and China, need to do more given the very different historical responsibility and financial capability of countries. An approach based on historical responsibility needed Fair-share emissions allocations distribute the global carbon budget among countries based on principles like historical responsibility, capability, and development needs, aiming to assign each country a 'fair share' of allowable emissions. Under the Paris Agreement, these allocations indicate what each country should commit to in order to collectively limit global warming to 1.5Â°C and staying well below 2Â°C. By calculating each ambition and fairness assessment from the present situation, we increasingly let major polluting countries off the hook. This pushes a heavier burden onto countries that have done the least to cause the crisis, or more realistically brings the world towards catastrophic levels of global warming. Therefore, the authors propose calculating fair-share emissions allocations immediately based on each country's historical contributions to climate change and their capacity to act. Accounting for immediate responsibilities sets a new baseline. It would cause some countries' emission paths to suddenly and drastically change instead of following a smooth decline. This approach would demand steep, immediate cuts mostly from wealthier, high-emitting countries. Since the cuts needed from these countries are too large to achieve locally, it requires substantial financial support for additional mitigation in poorer countries. Importantly, removing the systemic reward for inaction affects the ranking of countries' gap between their current pledges and fair emissions allocations, even within the group of high-income countries. Then, the USA, Australia, Canada, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have the greatest gap, requiring the most additional effort and finance. Much of equity discussions is about developed versus developing countries, but this paper is particularly relevant for developed countries being rewarded for inaction compared to other and more ambitious developed countries. Role in climate litigation Fair-share studies like this one are increasingly used in climate litigation, such as the KlimaSeniorinnen case before the European Court of Human Rights. The court recognised that insufficient national climate action constitutes a breach of human rights and that countries must justify how their climate pledges are a fair and ambitious contribution to the global objectives. Courts rely on these assessments to evaluate whether national emissions targets are sufficient and equitable. Biases in the assessments therefore have real-world impact: they can shape legal rulings, influence policy commitments, and inform public opinions. Courts are thus emerging as a key force in ensuring accountability and indirectly promoting cooperation when political and diplomatic negotiations fall short. In a landmark advisory opinion issued on July 23, 2025, the International Court of Justice affirmed that countries have a legal obligation under international law to prevent significant harm to the climate system, emphasising the duty to act collectively and urgently. \"This strengthens and underscores the growing role of courts in enforcing climate justice,\" says Robiou du Pont. Paying the debt Solving the climate crisis is a moral imperative long identified by climate justice activists and scholars. Practically, we are observing that the lack of fair efforts by countries with the greatest capacity and responsibility to act and provide finance, results in insufficient action globally. A fairer allocation of effort is likely to results in more ambitious outcomes globally. This study explains how immediate climate efforts and finance are key to align with international agreements to limiting global warming."

Dr Magnan said: \"Assessing climate adaptation is a burning scientific and policy question because, as today's global climate risk will experience a two- to four-fold increase by the end of this century depending on the global greenhouse gas emissions trajectory, we need to know the current status toward addressing its consequences. \"New, alternative methods to assess adaptation are urgently needed in order carry out effective planning and action, evidence on risk reduction, capabilities and create a long-term vision.\" The paper considered 61 coastal case studies to develop a locally informed perspective on the state of global coastal adaptation. It looked at both extreme events and low-onset climate change, including coastal erosion, marine flooding, sea-level rise and extremes, soil and groundwater salinization, inland flooding resulting from heavy precipitations, and permafrost thaw. While strategies for urban coastal areas are generally more advanced than rural ones, the experts said plans for long-term adaptations remain limited. The experts concluded that today's global coastal adaptation is half-way to the full adaptation potential. Taking sea-level rise as one example, the experts said the risks to low-lying coasts are already detectable. Prof Nicholls said: \"By the end of the century and in the absence of ambitious adaptation efforts, these risks will become significant, widespread and possibly irreversible in atolls and arctic coasts. The lower estimates for deltas are still a concern given these geographies' population sizes and economic importance globally.\" The expert group developed a qualitative structured judgment -- the Global Adaptation Progress Tracker (GAP-Track) -- to assess adaptation efforts, progress and gaps, as part of the framework for the Global Goal on Adaptation established under the Paris Agreement in 2015. Dr Magnan said: \"Countries still struggle finding a way to operationalize the Global Goal on Adaptation and to conduct the Global Stocktake (GST) series that aims to collectively track adaptation progress and gaps, with a first iteration due at COP28 in the United Arab Emirates. \"The multi-dimensional and locally grounded assessment developed in this study for coastal adaptation confirms the need to drastically scale up adaptation policy and action around the globe, from local governments and stakeholders to the international climate policy arena. \"We are arguing that the approach developed in this paper can play a decisive role in helping refine both targets and priorities.\""

The number of types found were similar to that previously found in the whole of the UK. The latest findings adds to a growing body of evidence that debunks the widely held belief that the Darwin wasp does not thrive in tropical environments and points to the possibility of many wasp species unknown to researchers in the past. Researchers say it also provides further evidence of the biodiversity of the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest and the significance of protecting and restoring the land from the effects of climate change and damage caused by human activities. The level of diversity in a group of species changes depending on where they live, and yet for invertebrates, some of the most diverse species on Earth, little is known about how much diversity can change from one location to the next. This can hinder conservation efforts, which is increasingly needed to maintain biodiversity in some of the most threatened areas of the world, such as rainforests. Researchers at the University of York surveyed a group of Darwin wasps, a very diverse and important invertebrate group worldwide, on a mountain of the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest to understand how common it was in a tropical environment and how it contributed to the biodiversity of the region. Dr Peter Mayhew, from the University of York's Department of Biology, said: \"For a long time it was believed that Darwin wasps favoured more moderate climates, but recent reports of their diversity in tropical locations started to prompt questions about this assumption. They can be found in varying numbers on every continent of the world, apart from Antartica, so they are a particularly fascinating creature. \"We found high biodiversity of the species at mid and low altitudes of the mountain but not at high altitudes, which gives us some guidance on where to concentrate conservation efforts for this population, but it was a surprise to see the level of diversity over the six months of our survey. \"Of the type of wasp we looked at, there are 1,700 described species worldwide, and about 109 in the UK. We found, on just one mountain in the rainforest, 98 species of these wasps, three quarters of which could not be named. As our work continues we may well be able to name some of them, but there is a strong likelihood that many will be species we have not encountered before.\" The wasps reproduce by parasitizing other insects and spiders until they are adult sized, and as such they are most vulnerable to human threats, which will reduce the number of insects they can choose from as host bodies. They are important to biodiversity as they kill their host insect, keeping insect populations regulated and allowing lots of different species to coexist. It is thought that wasps that parasitize other insects, such as the Darwin wasp, could be more diverse than beetles. Around 80,000 parasitic wasp species have been described, but they require more study to understand how their populations survive across a wide-range of environments around the globe. Researchers hope that these latest findings will contribute towards campaigns to reduce deforestation in the rainforest region and put in place conservation programmes that include this highly diverse group of species. The research, in collaboration with researchers at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and the National Institute of Amazonian Research in Brazil, and the University of Turku in Finland, is published in the journal Insects ."

Though bodies of water had filled the basin previously, the current sea formed in 1905, when water from the Colorado River breached an irrigation canal and spilled into the Salton Sink. Since 1907, the lake has been maintained mostly by runoff from the surrounding basin, including agricultural runoff and wastewater that flows in but not out, making the Salton Sea more saline than the Pacific Ocean. In the 1940s and 1950s, the area became a popular vacation destination, and new residents flocked to neighborhoods near the lakeshore. But during the second half of the 20 th century, lake levels began dropping rapidly, partly because of a hotter and dryer climate and partly because of policies that diverted more water away from the valley. Increasing concentrations of salt and nutrients from agricultural runoff created algal blooms that deprived the lake of oxygen, killing fish and plant life. That desiccating organic matter emits hydrogen sulfide, which has been shown to cause headaches, nausea, fatigue, as well as long-term neurological and respiratory effects at even low levels of exposure, the researchers say. For this study, researchers from Brown, the University of California, Los Angeles, Loma Linda University, and the University of California, Berkeley, worked with Alianza Coachella Valley, a local nonprofit community organization, to examine the causes of hydrogen-sulfide emissions from the lake. The researchers used data from weather stations and air-quality sensors installed by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), a local government agency serving Southern California. Those data were combined with data from remote sensing observations as well as additional air-quality sensors the research team placed within the lake. The study found that between 2013 and 2024, SCAQMD sensors in the communities of Indio, Mecca and the Torres Martinez Indian Reservation frequently showed hydrogen sulfide readings exceeding State of California standards. The exceedances were most likely in the summer and most pronounced at the Torres Martinez site, which is the closest of the three to the lake. In the month of August for each year from 2013 to 2024, Torres Martinez had an average of more than 250 hours of readings in excess of state standards. A comparison of wind direction data confirmed that exceedances tended to happen when the wind was blowing into communities from the direction of the lake. An additional sensor the research team placed in the shallow waters of the lake picked up consistently high hydrogen sulfide levels regardless of wind direction. That helps to confirm that the lake is indeed the source of hydrogen-sulfide emissions, and suggests that only a fraction of the total emissions is being captured by community-based regulatory sensors. Currently, only three of the numerous communities on the Salton Sea's long shoreline are monitored by regulatory agencies. \"Our results indicate that a significant portion of [hydrogen-sulfide] emissions remains unaccounted for, potentially being transported to communities without air monitoring stations,\" the researchers wrote. The findings highlight the need for increased air-quality monitoring around the Salton Sea, the researchers say. There's also a need for further study of the public health consequences of these emissions. \"Community residents exposed to hydrogen sulfide are impacted not only in their physical health -- experiencing respiratory irritation, headaches and fatigue -- but as well in their quality of life,\" said Diego Centeno, study co-author who carried out this work as a researcher at Brown University and is now a Ph.D. candidate at UCLA. \"As the sea's shoreline continues to recede and sulfate concentrations increase, there is a growing concern that hydrogen sulfide will emit more frequently and at greater magnitudes.\" The residents who live in the impacted communities are primarily Latinx and Indigenous (Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians) and already face elevated rates of asthma and other respiratory illnesses. \"This is a textbook case of environmental injustice,\" said Aydee Palomino, project manager for the Campaign for Thriving Salton Sea Communities at Alianza Coachella Valley and a study co-author. \"People in the Coachella and Imperial valleys are breathing in pollutants that are under the radar of traditional monitoring systems. Our work highlights the power of community science to expose these gaps and push for equitable solutions.\" The research was supported by Burroughs Wellcome Fund, the Google Environmental Justice Data Fund and NASA. Freilich learned in March 2025 that the NASA grant supporting this work had been terminated. She said the unexpected termination has disrupted planned follow-up work, including efforts to share and discuss the findings with members of the affected community."

The team used cutting-edge spatial and single-cell transcriptomics to compare rice roots grown in conventional gel-based media with those grown in heterogeneous natural soils and hard soils. One striking discovery involved the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), known for its role in water stress. The study showed ABA helps reinforce waterproofing barriers, reducing water loss from roots and aiding their resilience to hard soils. This insight offers a potential key to engineering crop roots with improved resilience to hard soil conditions. Soil is the foundation of life on land, producing over 90% of all terrestrial food. Yet, this dynamic ecosystem is far from uniform: it presents a constantly changing mosaic of nutrients, water availability, microbial life, and mechanical challenges. Understanding how root cells sense and respond to soil stresses is vital for future-proofing global food security. \"Seeing genes related to nutrient sensing, water response, and biotic stress light up ONLY in soil-grown roots was awe-inspiring\" said first author Mingyuan Zhu of Duke University. \"It was a striking moment that made the complexity of root-soil environment interactions feel vividly real.\" Dr Bipin Pandey from the University of Nottingham's School of Biosciences led the Nottingham research, he said: \"This is the first time such cell-resolution expression tools have been applied to roots grown in soil. Understanding root cell-specific responses in a realistic soil environment will pave the way for engineering crops at the cellular level -- tailored to work without disrupting critical processes in other root tissues. This breakthrough research exemplifies the power of interdisciplinary collaboration and represents a paradigm shift in plant biology -- transforming our ability to study processes in root cells from controlled lab conditions to the much more challenging, but realistic, conditions plants experience in soil. As climate change threatens soil quality and agricultural sustainability, such insights are not just scientifically exciting -- they are essential.\" The study also showed that the activation of plant response systems is not only regulated by genetic or biochemical process, but one that physically changes the plant's material properties on a cellular level. In collaboration with the University of Nottingham's Faculty of Engineering, the team used a new cellular resolution imaging technology called phonon microscopy to map changes in cell wall stiffness for roots grown in stressed and unstressed environments. \"We have discovered this incredible capability for plant roots to effectively 'brace for impact,' by stiffening their cell walls, when grown in soil that has been compacted.\" said Dr Salvatore La Cavera from the University of Nottingham's Faculty of Engineering, \"Plants prepare for extreme conditions almost like humans using sandbags to brace for a storm. By better understanding the material properties of plants we can help engineer plants with enhanced physical attributes that are better suited for our changing environment.\" The study also stands as a heartfelt tribute to the late Professor Philip Benfey, a key collaborator whose visionary ideas and approaches helped shape and launch this project.

We need to figure out a way to fix it and make it work.\" Part of what made the Green Revolution so revolutionary was the invention of synthetic, nitrogen-heavy fertilizers that could keep agricultural yields high. But they're expensive to make, they create an enormous amount of carbon dioxide, and much of the fertilizer washes away. Most crops only use about 40-60% of the nitrogen applied to them, a measurement known as nitrogen use efficiency, or NUE, and the NUE of rice can be as low as 30% -- which means that 70% of what a farmer puts on their fields washes away into streams, lakes and the oceans, causing eutrophication, dead zones and a host of other environmental problems. It also means that 70% of the cost of the fertilizer is likewise wasted. Furthermore, when nitrogen is applied to soils, it interacts with the soil's incredibly complex chemistry and microbes, and ultimately leads to vastly increased amounts of methane, ammonia and nitrous oxide -- all of which contribute to global warming. Furthermore, synthesizing fertilizer itself is a greenhouse-gas-heavy enterprise. \"Everybody knows that we need to improve NUE,\" says Xing -- the question is how? What Xing and his co-authors, including lead author Chuanxi Wang and another senior author, Zhenyu Wang, professors of environmental processes and pollution control at Jiangnan University discovered, is that nanoscale selenium, an element crucial for plant and human health, when applied to the foliage and stems of the rice, reduced the negative environmental impacts of nitrogen fertilization by 41% and increased the economic benefits by 38.2% per ton of rice, relative to conventional practices. \"We used an aerial drone to lightly spray rice growing in a paddy with the suspension of nanoscale selenium,\" says Wang. \"That direct contact means that the rice plant is far more efficient at absorbing the selenium than it would be if we applied it to the soil.\" Selenium stimulates the plant's photosynthesis, which increased by more than 40%. Increased photosynthesis means the plant absorbs more CO 2 , which it then turns into carbohydrates. Those carbohydrates flow down into the plant's roots, which causes them to grow. Bigger, healthier roots release a host of organic compounds that cultivate beneficial microbes in the soil, and it's these microbes that then work symbiotically with the rice roots to pull more nitrogen and ammonium out of the soil and into the plant, increasing its NUE from 30 to 48.3%, decreasing the amount of nitrous oxide and ammonia release to the atmosphere by 18.8-45.6%. With more nutrients coming in, the rice itself produces a higher yield, with a more nutritious grain: levels of protein, certain critical amino acids, and selenium also jumped. On top of all of this, Xing, Wang and their colleagues found that their nano-selenium applications allowed farmers to reduce their nitrogen applications by 30%. Since rice cultivation accounts for 15-20% of the global nitrogen use, this new technique holds real promise for helping to meet the triple threat of growing population, climate change, and the rising economic and environmental costs of agriculture."

Climate change threatens to worsen these issues, with rising temperatures, variable rainfall, and sea-level rise posing additional threats. Publishing their findings in Sustainable Development, experts from the University of Birmingham and Adeyemi Federal University of Education, Nigeria, have created a blueprint for green education across the MENA region with a series of recommendations including: Curriculum Integration -- develop comprehensive green education curricula to address local environmental issues and train teachers to deliver green education. Policy Support -- allocate funding, develop supportive policies, and integrate sustainability into national educational curricula. Collaborations and Partnerships -- share resources and best practices with NGOs, international organisations, and other educational institutions. Resource Allocation -- provide sustainable funding for education initiatives, whether from governments, international bodies, corporations, philanthropies, or NGOs. Monitoring and Evaluation -- implement robust monitoring and evaluation systems to assess the effectiveness of green education programmes. Active Engagement with International Initiatives -- align green education with global sustainability goals -- leveraging resources and support from international bodies.

These include significant curriculum gaps in the region's educational systems, made worse by highly centralised education structures, hindering the integration of green education. They also found insufficient funding for green education initiatives as many countries in the region allocate only a small proportion of GDP to education, with even less directed towards green initiatives. Co-author Dr Adenike Akinsemolu, from Adeyemi Federal University of Education, commented: \"In an era of environmental consciousness, the need to promote ecological awareness to enable sustainable development has never been more demanding in various regions like the MENA region. \"We must see increased investment and strategic allocation of resources to support the development of green education programmes. Teaching environmental issues as part of general curricula guarantees that sustainability is not an afterthought, but a standard component of education.\" The study not only highlights the challenges but also provides a roadmap for the future.

Damage assessments are typically conducted through field reconnaissance deployments, which can be labor-intensive, costly and risky. Moreover, field-based emergency response assessments can be hindered by delays and other setbacks due to the severity of the damage and the inability to access the hardest hit areas. Using remote sensing technology, Florida Atlantic University researchers have developed a novel technique that provides rapid, high-resolution assessments of detailed damage after a hurricane. Using aerial imagery data and LiDAR, they identified the hardest-hit areas of Southwest Florida's Estero Island and estimated the extent of structural damage. Researchers also compared pre- and post-storm structural or morphological changes to the beach. The study is the first to apply an advanced multi-faceted approach that links damage assessment to post-storm change in the structure of barrier islands. Results of the study, published in the Journal of Marine Science and Engineering , identified a total of 2,427 structures on Estero Island that were impacted by Hurricane Ian, with 170 structures suffering extensive damage. A single store was the only structure in the study area classified as \"not affected.\" Using data from the Lee County tax appraiser, researchers estimated the total assessed value of the heavily damaged structures at more than $200 million. Overall, 734 buildings had 30 to 50 percent structural damage, the majority of which were single-family and multi-unit residences. Researchers identified 158 buildings that were severely damaged with partial or complete roof failure. The highest percentage of damaged structures occurred on the central and northern portions of the island, where most of the structures were single-family and multi-family residences. Most of the structures that experienced 0 to 30 percent damage were classified as low-rise condominiums (three stories or less), commercial shopping centers and stores. Among the \"severely damaged\" and \"destroyed\" structures were seven mobile home subdivisions. \"Employing this advanced technology of aerial imagery and airborne LiDAR enabled us to collect extensive data from Hurricane Ian's aftermath and analyze large-scale datasets rather quickly,\" said Tiffany Roberts Briggs, Ph.D., senior author, chair and an associate professor in the Department of Geosciences within FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. The 2,427 structures were built between 1963 to 2019. The buildings in the areas where less damage was observed were built between 1963 and 1981. Similarly, in the areas of heavy damage, the majority of the buildings were built between 1963 and 1981. The spatial distribution of ground elevation and year built indicated no apparent trends associated with these two variables. \"We found no correlation between the ground elevation or year built for the extent of damages in this analysis, which emphasizes the role of the extreme inundation and importance of other factors contributing to vulnerability,\" said Roberts Briggs. \"Results from our study can help improve disaster planning by developing new policies and guidelines for coastal development in some of the most vulnerable and storm-exposed areas.\" Areas associated with little to no damage were spatially clustered in the southern and central portion of the island, with most structures concentrated on the landward side of the barrier island. \"The southern portion of Estero Island contains multiple saltwater marshes,\" said Leanne Hauptman, first author and a Ph.D. student in FAU's Department of Geosciences. \"Because of these saltwater marshes, storm-wave energy may been substantially dissipated by friction by the time the waves reached the barrier interior, potentially lessening the impact on the structures in that area.\" Findings also showed substantial post-storm debris and sand deposition across the entire island, and a notable deposition of sediment across the roadways and on the backside of the barrier, which is not readily returned seaward to the beach under post-storm conditions. Ponding water also was found hundreds of meters inland near buildings and other structures, providing evidence of the extent of inundation resulting from the storm. \"Although our study focused on Estero Island, this new remote sensing approach is generalizable,\" said Diana Mitsova, Ph.D., corresponding author, chair and professor, FAU Department of Urban and Regional Planning within the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science and an affiliate professor, FAU Department of Geosciences. \"As this technology continues to advance and becomes more readily available, it will offer a broad range of high-resolution coverage that can help prioritize emergency response efforts immediately following catastrophic natural disasters and other events.\" For the study, analysis of beach morphology was conducted by creating profile graphs to visualize elevation changes over a continuous distance. To measure structural damage, researchers use LiDAR tools to extract building footprints and building heights pre- and post-storm. Building footprints were overlaid on the post-imagery to estimate the total number of damaged buildings as well as the level of damage to each structure."

However, it does discuss the potential for increased severity of compound wind-rain extremes due to climate change, which can lead to more frequent windstorms coinciding with extreme rainfall and floods. This suggests that river-mouth cities, which are often vulnerable to both riverine and coastal flooding, could experience compound flooding when these extreme weather events occur simultaneously. This can result in significant challenges for such cities, particularly in terms of infrastructure and emergency response resources.

    "context": "[DOC 2015]\nThe new study was led by experts at Newcastle University and the Met Office and investigated how future climate change may influence compound wind-rain extremes, which are events where extreme wind and rainfall occur simultaneously. The researchers analysed data from climate simulations covering control (1981-2000) and future (2060-2081) periods, to assess potential changes in these extreme events. Their findings show that, as the climate warms, these events are likely to become more severe, with stronger winds and heavier rainfall happening together. These changes are mainly driven by increased rainfall, a thermodynamic response to rising temperatures. Additional contributing factors include a strengthened jet stream and its southward displacement that brings storms through warmer areas leading to further increases in rainfall. Publishing their findings in the journal Weather and Climate Extremes, the scientists show that the increase in intensity could lead to more frequent windstorms coinciding with extreme rainfall and floods, posing challenges to coastal areas susceptible to compound flooding as well as emergency response resources due to larger aggregation of separate impacts to infrastructure such as electricity networks and rail transport networks. Study lead author, Dr Colin Manning, Research Associate at Newcastle University's School of Engineering and Visiting Scientist, Met Office, Hadley Centre, said: \"Our work shows that such compound extremes will occur more frequently as our climate warms and likely bring more severe impacts, and a higher aggregation of separate damages arising from wind and flooding which may stretch emergency response resources. Avoiding the worst of these impacts will require cutting our greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the resilience of our infrastructure.\" The team used a number of methods to analyse compound wind-rain extremes and their future changes. They used an event-based analysis based on the occurrence of an extra-tropical cyclone (ETC) over the UK and Ireland. By linking extreme wind and rainfall events to these systems, the scientists assessed their severity using Wind Severity Index (WSI) and Rainfall Severity Index (RSI). Return periods (RPs) were estimated for both individual and joint extremes, indicating their likelihood, while the team categorised events based on their wind and rainfall characteristics. In addition, the researchers identified local co-occurrences of extreme wind gusts and rainfall to understand their changing intensity contributions in future simulations. Professor Lizzie Kendon, Head of Understanding Climate Change at the Met Office and co-author on the paper, said: \"This work exploits the latest high resolution climate projections for the UK, UKCP Local, where the Met Office weather forecast model has been run to give 100-y long climate projections at km-scale. These are providing new insights into how the UK climate may change at the very local scale, and how changes in weather extremes may be realised over the coming years and decades. This is highlighting the importance of considering compounding effects, including co-occurrences of different hazards, as well as the clustering of extreme events, in fully capturing the potential impacts of climate change.\" This research sets the stage for further investigation into the mechanisms driving compound wind-rain extremes. Future research will need to consider a greater range of climate models to understand if the results are robust across different models. Research is also required to understand and quantify the link between these compound extremes and the resultant impacts which would help stakeholders better understand their risk and choose the most cost-effective adaptations to reduce risks. The research was supported and funded by UKRI NERC funded STORMY-WEATHER project (NE/V004166/1)."

    "context": "[DOC 43]\nWhen two layers are twisted, electrons from each layer interfere strongly, reshaping their combined quantum landscape. A striking example of this effect is twisted bilayer graphene, where superconductivity -- a state in which electrons flow without resistance -- unexpectedly emerges, even though graphene layers individually cannot become superconducting. Electrons in materials have a quantum number called momentum, which essentially describes their quantum mechanical state of motion. Until now, the focus has predominantly been on hexagonal lattices twisted around what are known as K-points -- special points of electronic momentum symmetric under 120-degree rotations. Only a handful of materials such as graphene, MoTe2, MoSe2, and WSe2 have been explored experimentally. However, in new research published in Nature , a team of international researchers introduces an entirely new twisting paradigm based on the M-point of the electron momentum, significantly expanding the moirÃ© landscape. \"So far, all twisting has been around the K points, limiting us to a small corner of the material universe,\" explains Dumitru CÄƒlugÄƒru (PhD 2024, Princeton), a Leverhulme-Peierls fellow at the University of Oxford. \"By shifting our focus to the M points, we unlock a completely new class of twisted quantum materials with entirely new quantum behavior. The position of the electronic band minimum is key,\" says CÄƒlugÄƒru. The paper represents a significant international collaboration across multiple continents and institutions, including Princeton University (USA), Donostia International Physics Center (Spain), University of Oxford (UK), the Max Planck Society (Germany), Cornell University (USA), Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (Germany), University of Sherbrooke (Canada), and University of Florida (USA). The research team -- which includes theoretical physicists, computational physicists, and an international group of materials scientists and chemists who have begun synthesizing and exfoliating the proposed materials -- began by identifying hundreds of candidate materials suitable for this novel type of twisting. These materials were systematically classified based on the position of their electronic band minimum, a critical feature controlling the resulting quantum properties of the twisted layers. Out of these materials, two (SnSe 2 and ZrS 2 ) - with band minimum at the M point -- were chosen for the in-depth current study. \"Unlike K-point twisting, where moirÃ© bands typically exhibit topological characteristics, we found the M-point twisted bands to be topologically trivial yet remarkably flat,\" explained Haoyu Hu, a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton. \"However, the bands at the M-point possess a previously unnoticed type of symmetry, rendering them highly unusual and sometimes even one-dimensional. This fundamentally alters their quantum behavior,\" added Hu. Through extensive microscopic ab initio calculations -- requiring over six months of computational effort -- Yi Jiang and Hanqi Pi (Donostia International Physics Center) demonstrated that the electron bands become significantly flattened at low twist angles of about three degrees. Flattening electron bands effectively slows down electrons, enhancing their mutual interactions, and giving rise to novel quantum phenomena. \"This flattening can localize electrons in either a hexagonal lattice or a kagome lattice arrangement,\" Jiang noted. Pi further elaborated, \"Such localization means we can now experimentally realize diverse quantum states, potentially including quantum spin liquids.\" Quantum spin liquids, elusive states that have fascinated physicists, promise exciting applications including possible pathways to high-temperature superconductivity. However, they have never been conclusively observed experimentally in bulk materials, largely because of extreme difficulties in precisely controlling doping (adding or removing electrons) and other essential material properties. Twisted materials, however, offer greater experimental controllability due to their tunable structure and the possibility of electrostatic gating - a technique which allows the doping of electrons without degrading the material, overcoming many of these historical hurdles. The team's theoretical predictions and detailed electronic models represent a major step toward observing these states in realistic materials. Other phases of matter identified, such as unidirectional spin liquids and orthonormal dimer valence bond phases, are entirely new and unique to the M-point system. Yet, this research transcends theory. Collaborators in quantum materials chemistry -- Leslie Schoop (Princeton University) and Claudia Felser (Max Planck Institute, Dresden) -- have already successfully synthesized bulk crystals of several predicted candidate materials, providing the critical first step toward practical realization. World-leading experts in 2D materials -- including Dmitri Efetov (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich), Jie Shan, and Kin Fai Mak (both at Cornell University) -- then are exfoliating these bulk crystals into single-layer sheets, clearly to demonstrate the experimental feasibility of the proposed platform. \"The experimental realization of these materials is critical. Once twisted, gated, and measured, these new quantum states may become tangible realities,\" said B. Andrei Bernevig, Professor of Physics at Princeton University. Every new twist we perform seems to yield surprises. Fundamentally, these materials offer a gateway to quantum states of matter nobody has envisioned. Because they are so experimentally controllable, the possibilities truly are limitless,\" he emphasized."

We need to figure out a way to fix it and make it work.\" Part of what made the Green Revolution so revolutionary was the invention of synthetic, nitrogen-heavy fertilizers that could keep agricultural yields high. But they're expensive to make, they create an enormous amount of carbon dioxide, and much of the fertilizer washes away. Most crops only use about 40-60% of the nitrogen applied to them, a measurement known as nitrogen use efficiency, or NUE, and the NUE of rice can be as low as 30% -- which means that 70% of what a farmer puts on their fields washes away into streams, lakes and the oceans, causing eutrophication, dead zones and a host of other environmental problems. It also means that 70% of the cost of the fertilizer is likewise wasted. Furthermore, when nitrogen is applied to soils, it interacts with the soil's incredibly complex chemistry and microbes, and ultimately leads to vastly increased amounts of methane, ammonia and nitrous oxide -- all of which contribute to global warming. Furthermore, synthesizing fertilizer itself is a greenhouse-gas-heavy enterprise. \"Everybody knows that we need to improve NUE,\" says Xing -- the question is how? What Xing and his co-authors, including lead author Chuanxi Wang and another senior author, Zhenyu Wang, professors of environmental processes and pollution control at Jiangnan University discovered, is that nanoscale selenium, an element crucial for plant and human health, when applied to the foliage and stems of the rice, reduced the negative environmental impacts of nitrogen fertilization by 41% and increased the economic benefits by 38.2% per ton of rice, relative to conventional practices. \"We used an aerial drone to lightly spray rice growing in a paddy with the suspension of nanoscale selenium,\" says Wang. \"That direct contact means that the rice plant is far more efficient at absorbing the selenium than it would be if we applied it to the soil.\" Selenium stimulates the plant's photosynthesis, which increased by more than 40%. Increased photosynthesis means the plant absorbs more CO 2 , which it then turns into carbohydrates. Those carbohydrates flow down into the plant's roots, which causes them to grow. Bigger, healthier roots release a host of organic compounds that cultivate beneficial microbes in the soil, and it's these microbes that then work symbiotically with the rice roots to pull more nitrogen and ammonium out of the soil and into the plant, increasing its NUE from 30 to 48.3%, decreasing the amount of nitrous oxide and ammonia release to the atmosphere by 18.8-45.6%. With more nutrients coming in, the rice itself produces a higher yield, with a more nutritious grain: levels of protein, certain critical amino acids, and selenium also jumped. On top of all of this, Xing, Wang and their colleagues found that their nano-selenium applications allowed farmers to reduce their nitrogen applications by 30%. Since rice cultivation accounts for 15-20% of the global nitrogen use, this new technique holds real promise for helping to meet the triple threat of growing population, climate change, and the rising economic and environmental costs of agriculture."

In the study, civil unrest is classified as over 30,000 people in the UK suffering violent injury in one year through events such as demonstrations and violent looting. Just over 40% of the food experts surveyed believe that civil unrest in the UK in the next 10 years was either possible (38%) or more likely than not (3%). Over the next 50 years, this increased to nearly 80% of experts believing civil unrest was either possible (45%), more likely than not (24%), or very likely (10%). The participants were then asked, if disruption to the food system was to cause the unrest, was it likely to be due to not enough food being available overall, or problems with food distribution, preventing it getting to the right places and creating isolated pockets of hunger. They were asked to consider both questions over the two time frames, 10 and 50 years. The results show that 80% of experts believe logistical distribution issues leading to shortages are the most likely food-related cause of civil unrest in the next 10 years. But, considered over a 50-year horizon, they said catastrophic failure resulting in insufficient food to feed the UK population, rather than distribution problems, would be the most likely cause. The 58 experts who took part in the research were then asked to rank the possible causes of food shortages, and the foods most likely to provoke civil unrest. Wheat, bread, pasta and cereal are thought to be the types of food most likely to lead to unrest, while extreme weather -- including storm surges, flooding, snow and drought -- was chosen as the most likely cause of food shortages and food distribution issues over both the 10-year and 50-year time frames. However, rather than one single driver (extreme weather), the food experts felt that a combination of factors -- including ecological collapse, trade restrictions, a financial crash, rogue AI, a new pandemic, and animal or plant pathogens -- was most likely. Currently just under 50% of the UK's food is imported including 80% of fruit, 50% of vegetables, and 20% of beef and poultry, while the UK is almost completely self-sufficient for wheat, barley, lamb, and potatoes. Around 85% of food imports arrive via boat, and once in the UK, 98% of all food is transported by road. The researchers' aim is to highlight the potential vulnerability of the food system and the importance of developing plans to prepare and respond to these risks. They say the food system has been optimised for efficiency rather than resilience and faces major challenges in the future -- from not just climate change, but a combination of factors that increase the level of risk. Professor Sarah Bridle, Chair of Food, Climate and Society at the University of York, said: \"Covid 19, Brexit and the cost of living crisis have shown the UK is already exposed to certain risks. The food system faces significant challenges. We are experiencing an increasing number of extreme weather events, many driven by climate change. It is entirely possible that in the coming decades extreme weather will cause major crop yield failures across multiple breadbaskets. We need a food system designed not just for optimal efficiency, but also for resilience.\" Professor Aled Jones, Director of the Global Sustainability Institute at Anglia Ruskin University, and also lead author, said: \"By mapping out the potential risks, and their possible causes, we hope this report will assist with the preparations needed to avoid a UK food system catastrophe. \"Government agencies as well as business, must explore and fund options to increase the resilience of the food system including ecosystem restoration and management, storage and distribution, working conditions, sustainable farming practices, consumer engagement, as well as tackling food poverty and mitigating climate change. The Covid pandemic saw major disruption to food distribution and consumption from which lessons need to be learnt.\" Sue Newton, GB Food & Beverage Leader at WTW, said: \"In an increasingly connected world it has never been more important for businesses to think beyond single risks and solutions. Governments and businesses need to be ready for multiple scenarios, reactive when the exact situation doesn't unfold as scripted, and aware of the art of the possible. This research supports organisations in understanding the various pathways that might unfold to feed into their risk planning, and build resilience by identifying needs to support prevention, preparedness, response and recovery planning.\""

By combining a series of potential socioeconomic outcomes and climate change models reaching out to 2070, researchers examined several potential land use change scenarios to predict their effects on water quality. Katherine Martin, associate professor in the NC State University College of Natural Resources and co-author of a paper on the study, said that in models where forest cover was converted to other land uses, water quality suffered. \"In terms of aspects of water quality that we have long term data on, two of the biggest are nitrogen levels and the amount of sediment in the water. Looking at those two, in places where we're losing forest cover, we see both of those increasing,\" she said. \"Those are both detrimental to the quality of drinking water, and they require more filtration.\" Part of the issue, Martin said, is the relatively high level of fertilizer used in large-scale agriculture. Urban development results in large areas of impermeable surfaces, where rainwater cannot soak into the ground and instead runs off into rivers and streams. This causes the water to carry more sediment into those waterways than it would if it had been absorbed into the ground. Increased filtration has several knock-on effects, Martin said. Not only is it potentially harmful for aquatic life, but it also increases the cost of managing water treatment plants. For facilities that do not serve large populations, this can lead to large per-capita price increases that end up being passed on to residents. These areas are also more likely to see increased development, due to their abundance of open land. The study suggests that more attention should be paid to where development might have serious effects on water quality for people living nearby, Martin said. \"Agriculture and urban development are beneficial, and this study does not say otherwise,\" she said. \"What we are seeing is that there are tradeoffs when we lose forest cover, and we need to open up the conversation about those.\" This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Southern Research Station agreement number 20-CS-11330180-053.\n\n[DOC 188]\nUrban greenery monitoring has traditionally been a very labor-intensive process, requiring botanical expertise and considerable resources. With cities expanding worldwide and urban environments becoming more complex, keeping track of plant health has also become more difficult. Could artificial intelligence (AI) hold the key to addressing this challenge? In a recent study, a joint research team led by Professor Umezu's Laboratory from the Department of Life Science and Medical Bioscience at Waseda University and Professor Shiojiri's Laboratory from the Faculty of Agriculture at Ryukoku University developed an innovative AI-driven solution for monitoring plant health. Their paper was published online in the journal Measurement on February 22, 2025, and will be published in Volume 249, on May 31, 2025. This study introduces 'Plant Doctor,' a hybrid AI system that automatically diagnoses urban tree health through video footage captured by ordinary cameras. \" Machine vision techniques such as segmentation have great applications in the medical field. We wanted to extrapolate this technology to other areas, such as plant health ,\" says first author Marques, explaining their motivation. Plant Doctor combines two cutting-edge machine vision algorithms -- YOLOv8 and DeepSORT -- to identify and track individual leaves across video frames. The goal of these algorithms is to ensure that only the best images for each leaf are selected for further processing. Then, a third algorithm, called DeepLabV3Plus, performs detailed image segmentation to precisely quantify leaf damage. The proposed system can automatically detect diseased areas on individual leaves, such as spots caused by bacteria, pests, and fungi. One of the most attractive aspects of this approach is its scalability and cost efficiency. The system can process video footage collected by cameras mounted not only on drones but also on city maintenance vehicles like garbage trucks, turning routine services into opportunities to gather data without investing substantial resources. Moreover, by using images rather than actual branches and leaves, Plant Doctor minimizes stress on city plants. \" We have provided a tool for botanical experts to assess plant health in one solution without the need to gather samples and damage the plants in the process ,\" remarks Marques. The research team validated the proposed system using footage of urban plants in Tokyo, obtaining favorable results and remarkably accurate leaf health diagnoses across various urban flora. By combining plant health data with accurate location information, Plant Doctor enables both a micro-level analysis of individual plants and macro-level insights into disease patterns across urban areas. Worth noting, beyond urban applications, Plant Doctor could also be adapted for agricultural use, helping farmers monitor crop health and identify diseases before they spread. Overall, the proposed technology represents a significant step toward more sustainable urban and rural plant health monitoring, allowing botanical experts to focus more on strategic interventions rather than routine monitoring."

    "context": "[DOC 2015]\nThe new study was led by experts at Newcastle University and the Met Office and investigated how future climate change may influence compound wind-rain extremes, which are events where extreme wind and rainfall occur simultaneously. The researchers analysed data from climate simulations covering control (1981-2000) and future (2060-2081) periods, to assess potential changes in these extreme events. Their findings show that, as the climate warms, these events are likely to become more severe, with stronger winds and heavier rainfall happening together. These changes are mainly driven by increased rainfall, a thermodynamic response to rising temperatures. Additional contributing factors include a strengthened jet stream and its southward displacement that brings storms through warmer areas leading to further increases in rainfall. Publishing their findings in the journal Weather and Climate Extremes, the scientists show that the increase in intensity could lead to more frequent windstorms coinciding with extreme rainfall and floods, posing challenges to coastal areas susceptible to compound flooding as well as emergency response resources due to larger aggregation of separate impacts to infrastructure such as electricity networks and rail transport networks. Study lead author, Dr Colin Manning, Research Associate at Newcastle University's School of Engineering and Visiting Scientist, Met Office, Hadley Centre, said: \"Our work shows that such compound extremes will occur more frequently as our climate warms and likely bring more severe impacts, and a higher aggregation of separate damages arising from wind and flooding which may stretch emergency response resources. Avoiding the worst of these impacts will require cutting our greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the resilience of our infrastructure.\" The team used a number of methods to analyse compound wind-rain extremes and their future changes. They used an event-based analysis based on the occurrence of an extra-tropical cyclone (ETC) over the UK and Ireland. By linking extreme wind and rainfall events to these systems, the scientists assessed their severity using Wind Severity Index (WSI) and Rainfall Severity Index (RSI). Return periods (RPs) were estimated for both individual and joint extremes, indicating their likelihood, while the team categorised events based on their wind and rainfall characteristics. In addition, the researchers identified local co-occurrences of extreme wind gusts and rainfall to understand their changing intensity contributions in future simulations. Professor Lizzie Kendon, Head of Understanding Climate Change at the Met Office and co-author on the paper, said: \"This work exploits the latest high resolution climate projections for the UK, UKCP Local, where the Met Office weather forecast model has been run to give 100-y long climate projections at km-scale. These are providing new insights into how the UK climate may change at the very local scale, and how changes in weather extremes may be realised over the coming years and decades. This is highlighting the importance of considering compounding effects, including co-occurrences of different hazards, as well as the clustering of extreme events, in fully capturing the potential impacts of climate change.\" This research sets the stage for further investigation into the mechanisms driving compound wind-rain extremes. Future research will need to consider a greater range of climate models to understand if the results are robust across different models. Research is also required to understand and quantify the link between these compound extremes and the resultant impacts which would help stakeholders better understand their risk and choose the most cost-effective adaptations to reduce risks.

These conditions limit the opportunities. Now, a new study led by UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain has found that that climate change is further reducing the overall number of days and changing the times of year when prescribed fires can be safely used. Currently, scientists project warming of 2.0 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2060 -- a projection Swain called \"optimistic\" given the current trajectory of even greater warming. Still, these temperatures would reduce the number of days when weather and vegetation conditions favor prescribed fires by 17% on average across the Western U.S. Most reductions would come in spring and summer, when most prescribed burns are currently implemented. Yet in winter, the research projects a net 4% increase in the number of favorable days for prescribed fire. Paper co-author Kristen Shive, a UC Berkeley expert on forests, wildfires and prescribed fire, said specific burn prescriptions vary by location and vegetation type, but target temperatures commonly range from 50-70 degrees Fahrenheit with 10-20% relative humidity. Climate change will require the agencies responsible for prescribed burns to adjust, Swain said, because most personnel who prepare for and manage prescribed fires are seasonal workers whose jobs end by mid-autumn each year. Going forward, the use of prescribed fires will require changes in staff availability. \"Global warming will reduce the number of favorable days for prescribed fires throughout the American West, but winter in particular may emerge as an increasingly favorable time for prescribed burns if the relevant policy and staffing changes can be made,\" Swain said. The researchers also found regional variation in the changes. In California, for example, the changes are most pronounced in coastal and southern parts of the state, with many places losing a month of days suitable for prescribed fires each year. The northern parts of the Rocky Mountains, on the other hand, may see a modest increase in days when it's safe to use these fires. Yet not much will change in the short term, according to Swain. \"We're just not doing a lot of prescribed fire compared to what is needed, at scale, to really address the escalating wildfire crisis,\" he said. The study, published in Communications Earth and Environment , a Nature journal, included research from UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Merced and the Nature Conservancy. It focused on historical and projected climate conditions and vegetation dryness, comparing 1980-2020 with 2020-2060. The researchers did not address other factors important to the use of prescribed fire: impact on ecology, public policy considerations, effects of smoke on humans and wildlife, and availability of staff to do prescribed burns. As wildfires in the American West have dramatically increased for a variety of reasons -- including climate change, human development in fire-prone areas and aggressive fire suppression in the 20th century -- tools like prescribed fires will only become more critical. Anticipating future opportunities and limitations to the use of this tool enables agencies to plan ahead, particularly as regards the firefighting work force. \"This paper is giving us advanced warning,\" Shive said. \"Hopefully we can change policies to either extend those folks or create winter-specific crews.\""

The research, published in the journal CABI Agriculture and Bioscience , assessed the reasons why people -- as part of the CABI-led Woody Weeds Project -- in Baringo, Kenya, and Kahe, Tanzania, adopted the SLM practice, or not, as well as if there was an effect of the project on the adoption. The novelty of this study was that the scientists found that the SLM practice was adopted by people in the two regions who were not directly involved in the project activities. 75% of households implemented the SLM practice The scientists found that about 75% of the 154 interviewed households in Baringo and 148 interviewed households in Kahe implemented the SLM practice while 76 did not and 10 no longer implemented the practice to control the spiny shrub or tree known as Prosopis juliflora . They also discovered that the likelihood of people adopting was higher for male than female respondents and was positively related to farm size. Prosopis juliflora was introduced from its native Latin America into Eastern Africa to reduce dust storms and provide wood and fodder for livestock but is has spread from the original areas of introduction and invaded large areas of land, thereby replacing grazing and arable land with impenetrable thickets. Winnie Nunda, Research Officer, Invasive Species Management and an author of the study, said, \"Our results show that all respondents prefer the SLM over a situation where their land is invaded by prosopis, even if the investment to uproot prosopis is high.\" Respondents preferred SLM over invaded land Dr RenÃ© Eschen, an author of the research and Research Scientist, Ecosystems Management, and Risk Analysis and Invasion Ecology at CABI, said, \"This confirms that people prefer farming over prosopis, and their perception of the SLM became more positive over time. Altogether our results illustrate the beneficial effects of SLM practice, despite high initial investment and risk of injury while uprooting prosopis.\" Dr Charles Kilawe, of Sokoine University of Agriculture and a co-author of the research, added that the results further indicate the value of communal meetings for dissemination, as many people learn about new practices through observation of their neighbour's activities and during public barazas. Favourable benefit:cost ratio of the practice Dr Kilawe said, \"The ability to see the practice being implemented and discuss practical aspects and the favourable benefit:cost ratio of the practice with those who were involved in implementation, either land users or project staff, may have convinced other people of the benefits of crop production over prosopis. \"Given the positive opinion of people who have adopted the practice in the two regions, and that most interviewees prefer the practice over not managing prosopis, we propose upscaling of the practice to other areas infested by prosopis. \"Promoting the practice in new areas through implementation by stakeholders at demonstration sites as well as through community meetings may increase the rate of adoption.\" The scientists further stress that the result of their study highlights the need for further projects aiming at engaging residents of other regions, in East Africa and elsewhere in the world where prosopis is invasive, in sustainably managing prosopis infested lands."

We need to figure out a way to fix it and make it work.\" Part of what made the Green Revolution so revolutionary was the invention of synthetic, nitrogen-heavy fertilizers that could keep agricultural yields high. But they're expensive to make, they create an enormous amount of carbon dioxide, and much of the fertilizer washes away. Most crops only use about 40-60% of the nitrogen applied to them, a measurement known as nitrogen use efficiency, or NUE, and the NUE of rice can be as low as 30% -- which means that 70% of what a farmer puts on their fields washes away into streams, lakes and the oceans, causing eutrophication, dead zones and a host of other environmental problems. It also means that 70% of the cost of the fertilizer is likewise wasted. Furthermore, when nitrogen is applied to soils, it interacts with the soil's incredibly complex chemistry and microbes, and ultimately leads to vastly increased amounts of methane, ammonia and nitrous oxide -- all of which contribute to global warming. Furthermore, synthesizing fertilizer itself is a greenhouse-gas-heavy enterprise. \"Everybody knows that we need to improve NUE,\" says Xing -- the question is how? What Xing and his co-authors, including lead author Chuanxi Wang and another senior author, Zhenyu Wang, professors of environmental processes and pollution control at Jiangnan University discovered, is that nanoscale selenium, an element crucial for plant and human health, when applied to the foliage and stems of the rice, reduced the negative environmental impacts of nitrogen fertilization by 41% and increased the economic benefits by 38.2% per ton of rice, relative to conventional practices. \"We used an aerial drone to lightly spray rice growing in a paddy with the suspension of nanoscale selenium,\" says Wang. \"That direct contact means that the rice plant is far more efficient at absorbing the selenium than it would be if we applied it to the soil.\" Selenium stimulates the plant's photosynthesis, which increased by more than 40%. Increased photosynthesis means the plant absorbs more CO 2 , which it then turns into carbohydrates. Those carbohydrates flow down into the plant's roots, which causes them to grow. Bigger, healthier roots release a host of organic compounds that cultivate beneficial microbes in the soil, and it's these microbes that then work symbiotically with the rice roots to pull more nitrogen and ammonium out of the soil and into the plant, increasing its NUE from 30 to 48.3%, decreasing the amount of nitrous oxide and ammonia release to the atmosphere by 18.8-45.6%. With more nutrients coming in, the rice itself produces a higher yield, with a more nutritious grain: levels of protein, certain critical amino acids, and selenium also jumped. On top of all of this, Xing, Wang and their colleagues found that their nano-selenium applications allowed farmers to reduce their nitrogen applications by 30%. Since rice cultivation accounts for 15-20% of the global nitrogen use, this new technique holds real promise for helping to meet the triple threat of growing population, climate change, and the rising economic and environmental costs of agriculture."

Furthermore, synthesizing fertilizer itself is a greenhouse-gas-heavy enterprise. \"Everybody knows that we need to improve NUE,\" says Xing -- the question is how? What Xing and his co-authors, including lead author Chuanxi Wang and another senior author, Zhenyu Wang, professors of environmental processes and pollution control at Jiangnan University discovered, is that nanoscale selenium, an element crucial for plant and human health, when applied to the foliage and stems of the rice, reduced the negative environmental impacts of nitrogen fertilization by 41% and increased the economic benefits by 38.2% per ton of rice, relative to conventional practices. \"We used an aerial drone to lightly spray rice growing in a paddy with the suspension of nanoscale selenium,\" says Wang. \"That direct contact means that the rice plant is far more efficient at absorbing the selenium than it would be if we applied it to the soil.\" Selenium stimulates the plant's photosynthesis, which increased by more than 40%. Increased photosynthesis means the plant absorbs more CO 2 , which it then turns into carbohydrates. Those carbohydrates flow down into the plant's roots, which causes them to grow. Bigger, healthier roots release a host of organic compounds that cultivate beneficial microbes in the soil, and it's these microbes that then work symbiotically with the rice roots to pull more nitrogen and ammonium out of the soil and into the plant, increasing its NUE from 30 to 48.3%, decreasing the amount of nitrous oxide and ammonia release to the atmosphere by 18.8-45.6%. With more nutrients coming in, the rice itself produces a higher yield, with a more nutritious grain: levels of protein, certain critical amino acids, and selenium also jumped. On top of all of this, Xing, Wang and their colleagues found that their nano-selenium applications allowed farmers to reduce their nitrogen applications by 30%. Since rice cultivation accounts for 15-20% of the global nitrogen use, this new technique holds real promise for helping to meet the triple threat of growing population, climate change, and the rising economic and environmental costs of agriculture."

They also demonstrate how modern data-mining tools can uncover hidden threats in samples collected well before the virus was on anyone's radar. \"CLRDV was officially detected in 2017, so the assumption was that it had only recently entered the U.S.,\" said Alejandro Olmedo-Velarde, formerly a Cornell postdoctoral associate and now Assistant Professor in the Department of Plant Pathology, Entomology, and Microbiology at Iowa State. \"Our study shows that this virus was actually present in the country's Cotton Belt long before that. We found clear evidence of the virus in samples from 2006 in Mississippi, 2015 in Louisiana, and 2018 in California.\" To confirm the findings, the team conducted field surveys in 2023, collecting fresh cotton samples in Southern California. Lab testing confirmed that CLRDV is currently present in California -- marking the state's first official report of the virus. The team's approach relied heavily on reanalyzing existing data in public genetic databases. By mining these datasets, the researchers uncovered viral sequences that closely matched current U.S. strains, offering a more complete picture of CLRDV's spread over time and geography. The study underscores the importance of maintaining easily accessible, publicly available databases for improving future disease surveillance and preparedness. In an unexpected twist, the researchers also identified traces of the virus in an unusual location: a sample from the gut of a cow studied by researchers in California. Their data are consistent with the hypothesis that the cow ingested CLRDV-infected plant-based animal feed. While this does not suggest that animals are infected, it adds a new dimension to understanding the timeline and extent of CLRDV infection in the U.S. prior to the official first report. The study also reignites interest in an unresolved issue in cotton pathology: bronze wilt. The researchers propose a potential connection between CLRDV and bronze wilt symptoms, a topic that has sparked debate in the past. \"Now, as more studies align with our findings, the idea is gaining traction,\" said Olmedo-Velarde. \"It could help explain long-standing crop losses and inform virus monitoring strategies moving forward.\" Agricultural Research Service Scientist Dr. Michelle Heck explains, \"For growers, the findings offer both a caution and a call to action. CLRDV has been in U.S. fields far longer than anyone realized, and it may be more widespread than current reports suggest. Understanding how and why the virus remained under the radar for so long -- and why it's becoming more of a problem now -- will be critical for developing effective management strategies.\" The research highlights the growing role of bioinformatics, plant pathology, and cross-disciplinary collaboration in modern agriculture -- and shows that existing data may already contain the clues we need to detect emerging threats earlier."

    "context": "[DOC 2015]\nThe new study was led by experts at Newcastle University and the Met Office and investigated how future climate change may influence compound wind-rain extremes, which are events where extreme wind and rainfall occur simultaneously. The researchers analysed data from climate simulations covering control (1981-2000) and future (2060-2081) periods, to assess potential changes in these extreme events. Their findings show that, as the climate warms, these events are likely to become more severe, with stronger winds and heavier rainfall happening together. These changes are mainly driven by increased rainfall, a thermodynamic response to rising temperatures. Additional contributing factors include a strengthened jet stream and its southward displacement that brings storms through warmer areas leading to further increases in rainfall. Publishing their findings in the journal Weather and Climate Extremes, the scientists show that the increase in intensity could lead to more frequent windstorms coinciding with extreme rainfall and floods, posing challenges to coastal areas susceptible to compound flooding as well as emergency response resources due to larger aggregation of separate impacts to infrastructure such as electricity networks and rail transport networks. Study lead author, Dr Colin Manning, Research Associate at Newcastle University's School of Engineering and Visiting Scientist, Met Office, Hadley Centre, said: \"Our work shows that such compound extremes will occur more frequently as our climate warms and likely bring more severe impacts, and a higher aggregation of separate damages arising from wind and flooding which may stretch emergency response resources. Avoiding the worst of these impacts will require cutting our greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the resilience of our infrastructure.\" The team used a number of methods to analyse compound wind-rain extremes and their future changes. They used an event-based analysis based on the occurrence of an extra-tropical cyclone (ETC) over the UK and Ireland. By linking extreme wind and rainfall events to these systems, the scientists assessed their severity using Wind Severity Index (WSI) and Rainfall Severity Index (RSI). Return periods (RPs) were estimated for both individual and joint extremes, indicating their likelihood, while the team categorised events based on their wind and rainfall characteristics. In addition, the researchers identified local co-occurrences of extreme wind gusts and rainfall to understand their changing intensity contributions in future simulations. Professor Lizzie Kendon, Head of Understanding Climate Change at the Met Office and co-author on the paper, said: \"This work exploits the latest high resolution climate projections for the UK, UKCP Local, where the Met Office weather forecast model has been run to give 100-y long climate projections at km-scale. These are providing new insights into how the UK climate may change at the very local scale, and how changes in weather extremes may be realised over the coming years and decades. This is highlighting the importance of considering compounding effects, including co-occurrences of different hazards, as well as the clustering of extreme events, in fully capturing the potential impacts of climate change.\" This research sets the stage for further investigation into the mechanisms driving compound wind-rain extremes. Future research will need to consider a greater range of climate models to understand if the results are robust across different models. Research is also required to understand and quantify the link between these compound extremes and the resultant impacts which would help stakeholders better understand their risk and choose the most cost-effective adaptations to reduce risks. The research was supported and funded by UKRI NERC funded STORMY-WEATHER project (NE/V004166/1)."

Bolides are the bright flashes and booms from large meteoroids breaking apart high in the sky. These events release huge amounts of energy, creating shock waves that travel as infrasound signals across thousands of kilometers. But here's the challenge: bolides aren't like explosions that happen in one place. They are moving, generating sound along their path as they travel through the sky. This movement matters, especially for meteoroids and space debris that enter shallow angles. In those cases, different infrasound stations might pick up signals coming from different directions, making it harder to pinpoint the source. Motivated by this problem, Silber used a network of infrasound sensors around the world maintained by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), an organization tasked with listening for illicit explosions. These instruments also record anything else that claps or booms, from thunder to supersonic aircraft. Using signals specifically from bolides, Silber isolated the purely geometric component for her analysis. She found that if a bolide enters Earth's atmosphere at a relatively steep angle -- greater than 60Â° -- analysis of the infrasound signal gets the trajectory right. But when it comes more horizontally, the uncertainty increases. \"Infrasound from a bolide is more like a sonic boom stretched across the sky than a single bang,\" Silber says. \"You must account for the fact that the sound is being generated along the flight path.\" And so, this study highlights a critical need: to consider the trajectory of an object when interpreting infrasound data. Infrasound instruments are indispensable for planetary defense, according to Silber, and the findings are relevant to Earth-bound space junk. If you don't know where something is going, then you have a hard time preparing for it."

Still, challenges remain. The chemical complexity of bio-tar makes it difficult to fully control the polymerization process, and large-scale production has not yet been achieved. The authors recommend combining laboratory experiments with computer simulations and machine learning to optimize reaction pathways and design bio-carbon with specific functions. \"Bio-tar polymerization is not just about waste treatment -- it represents a new frontier for creating sustainable carbon materials,\" said first author Yuxuan Sun. \"With further research, this approach could significantly improve the efficiency of biomass energy systems while providing new tools for environmental protection and clean technology.\" The study provides a roadmap for scientists and industry partners to turn one of bioenergy's biggest obstacles into a powerful resource for the future."

    "context": "[DOC 2008]\nScientists at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory completed a study of how well vegetation survived extreme heat events in both urban and rural communities across the country in recent years. The analysis informs pathways for climate mitigation, including ways to reduce the effect of urban heat islands. Vegetation such as trees provide a valuable cooling effect, shading surfaces and deflecting solar radiation while releasing moisture into the atmosphere through evapotranspiration -- the process in which plants absorb water through their roots and release it as water vapor through their leaves. The study, published in the journal PNAS Nexus , is the first nationwide accounting of vegetation resilience that takes into account the influence of human-built infrastructure. Using machine learning methods, ORNL researchers examined about two decades' worth of satellite and other data covering 85 large cities and surrounding rural areas. The team found that impervious surfaces such as roads and other infrastructure, moisture conditions and type of land cover affect vegetation resilience. They also evaluated how vegetation is impacted by the intensity, duration and timing of heat waves. The data provide crucial insights into how ecosystems can be guarded against climate change, including pathways to counteract the influence of urban heat islands and to improve the stewardship of natural resource areas, said Jiafu Mao, ORNL Earth system modeling scientist and the project's lead. \"The empirical evidence we provide from this research can help urban planners better understand which plants are more vulnerable to heat waves and stressors such as water availability in the local environment, guiding decisions about plant selection and location and urban design improvements,\" Mao said. \"The study suggests that preserving and enhancing vegetation could significantly contribute to urban sustainability, air quality improvements and the well-being of residents.\" The work extends ORNL's research on climate impacts in urban and rural ecosystems. In a previous study, Mao and colleagues found that while all regions of the country can expect an earlier start to the growing season as temperatures rise, the trend is likely to become more variable year over year in hotter regions. The research found a trend of accelerated spring budding and blooming of plants in rural areas as temperatures rise, for instance, but suggested the trend will slow as warming continues. Identifying patterns to guide local decision-making The new vegetation resilience study described in PNAS Nexus revealed a general trend of increased early greening in response to warmer temperatures in traditionally cooler months. But as temperatures soared and heat persisted, vegetation greening often significantly declined, said Yaoping Wang, an ORNL postdoctoral research associate and first author on the paper. The study identified a temperature of 2 degrees Celsius or higher above the historical summer average persisting for four months or more as the threshold for the most significant effects on greening. Findings varied with local ecosystem characteristics. For instance, urban vegetation was found more resilient in the western United States than in the East during the analysis period, mainly because of higher urban growth temperatures and better irrigation practices in the West, the scientists noted. \"Our analysis is the first large-scale quantification of urban and rural differences in vegetation and its resilience to extreme events across the contiguous U.S., capturing these very broad patterns on environmental change,\" Wang said. Future investigations that capture more high-quality data would benefit both urban planners and ecosystem modelers, she added. The project provides valuable data on the complex interactions between biological and environmental factors at multiple scales over time, down to a 1-kilomenter resolution, Mao said. The information has also been used to fine-tune the land surface component that ORNL stewards for the DOE Energy Exascale Earth System Model, which simulates how the world may change in future climate scenarios. The analysis used the Daymet4 database of daily land surface weather and climatological summaries, part of the ORNL Distributed Active Archive Center maintained for NASA's Earth Science Data and Information System project. Scientists also leveraged the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index from NASA and the National Land Cover Database, maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey. The researchers used the random forest machine learning algorithm and other methods in their analysis, as well as the high-performance computing resources of the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, a DOE Office of Science user facility."

Lead author Dr Holly Stemp says the achievement unlocks the potential to build the future microchips needed for quantum computing using existing technology and manufacturing processes. \"We succeeded in making the cleanest, most isolated quantum objects talk to each other, at the scale at which standard silicon electronic devices are currently fabricated,\" she says. The challenge facing quantum computer engineers has been to balance two opposing needs: shielding the computing elements from external interference and noise, while still enabling them to interact to perform meaningful computations. This is why there are so many different types of hardware still in the race to be the first operating quantum computer: some are very good for performing fast operations, but suffer from noise; others are well shielded from noise, but difficult to operate and scale up. The UNSW team has invested on a platform that - until today - could be placed in the second camp. They have used the nuclear spin of phosphorus atoms, implanted in a silicon chip, to encode quantum information. \"The spin of an atomic nucleus is the cleanest, most isolated quantum object one can find in the solid state,\" says Scientia Professor Andrea Morello, UNSW School of Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications. \"Over the last 15 years, our group has pioneered all the breakthroughs that made this technology a real contender in the quantum computing race. We already demonstrated that we could hold quantum information for over 30 seconds - an eternity, in the quantum world - and perform quantum logic operations with less than 1% errors. \"We were the first in the world to achieve this in a silicon device, but it all came at a price: the same isolation that makes atomic nuclei so clean, makes it hard to connect them together in a large-scale quantum processor.\" Until now, the only way to operate multiple atomic nuclei was for them to be placed very close together inside a solid, and to be surrounded by one and the same electron. \"Most people think of an electron as the tiniest subatomic particle, but quantum physics tells us that it has the ability to 'spread out' in space, so that it can interact with multiple atomic nuclei,\" says Dr Holly Stemp, who conducted this research at UNSW and is now a postdoctoral researcher at MIT in Boston. \"Even so, the range over which the electron can spread is quite limited. Moreover, adding more nuclei to the same electron makes it very challenging to control each nucleus individually.\" Making atomic nuclei talk through electronic 'telephones' \"By way of metaphor one could say that, until now, nuclei were like people placed in a sound-proof room,\" Dr Stemp says. \"They can talk to each other as long as they are all in the same room, and the conversations are really clear. But they can't hear anything from the outside, and there's only so many people who can fit inside the room. This mode of conversation doesn't 'scale'. \"With this breakthrough, it's as if we gave people telephones to communicate to other rooms. All the rooms are still nice and quiet on the inside, but now we can have conversations between many more people, even if they are far away.\" The 'telephones' are, in fact, electrons. Mark van Blankenstein, another author on the paper, explains what's really going on at the sub-atomic level. \"By their ability to spread out in space, two electrons can 'touch' each other at quite some distance. And if each electron is directly coupled to an atomic nucleus, the nuclei can communicate through that.\" So how far apart were the nuclei involved in the experiments? \"The distance between our nuclei was about 20 nanometers - one thousandth of the width of a human hair,\" says Dr Stemp. \"That doesn't sound like much, but consider this: if we scaled each nucleus to the size of a person, the distance between the nuclei would be about the same as that between Sydney and Boston!\" She adds that 20 nanometers is the scale at which modern silicon computer chips are routinely manufactured to work in personal computers and mobile phones. \"You have billions of silicon transistors in your pocket or in your bag right now, each one about 20 nanometers in size. This is our real technological breakthrough: getting our cleanest and most isolated quantum objects talking to each other at the same scale as existing electronic devices. This means we can adapt the manufacturing processes developed by the trillion-dollar semiconductor industry, to the construction of quantum computers based on the spins of atomic nuclei.\" A scalable way forward Despite the exotic nature of the experiments, the researchers say these devices remain fundamentally compatible with the way all current computer chips are built. The phosphorus atoms were introduced in the chip by the team of Professor David Jamieson at the University of Melbourne, using an ultra-pure silicon slab supplied by Professor Kohei Itoh at Keio University in Japan. By removing the need for the atomic nuclei to be attached to the same electron, the UNSW team has swept aside the biggest roadblock to the scale-up of silicon quantum computers based on atomic nuclei. \"Our method is remarkably robust and scalable. Here we just used two electrons, but in the future we can even add more electrons, and force them in an elongated shape, to spread out the nuclei even further,\" Prof. Morello says. \"Electrons are easy to move around and to 'massage' into shape, which means the interactions can be switched on and off quickly and precisely. That's exactly what is needed for a scalable quantum computer.\""

These conditions limit the opportunities. Now, a new study led by UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain has found that that climate change is further reducing the overall number of days and changing the times of year when prescribed fires can be safely used. Currently, scientists project warming of 2.0 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2060 -- a projection Swain called \"optimistic\" given the current trajectory of even greater warming. Still, these temperatures would reduce the number of days when weather and vegetation conditions favor prescribed fires by 17% on average across the Western U.S. Most reductions would come in spring and summer, when most prescribed burns are currently implemented. Yet in winter, the research projects a net 4% increase in the number of favorable days for prescribed fire. Paper co-author Kristen Shive, a UC Berkeley expert on forests, wildfires and prescribed fire, said specific burn prescriptions vary by location and vegetation type, but target temperatures commonly range from 50-70 degrees Fahrenheit with 10-20% relative humidity. Climate change will require the agencies responsible for prescribed burns to adjust, Swain said, because most personnel who prepare for and manage prescribed fires are seasonal workers whose jobs end by mid-autumn each year. Going forward, the use of prescribed fires will require changes in staff availability. \"Global warming will reduce the number of favorable days for prescribed fires throughout the American West, but winter in particular may emerge as an increasingly favorable time for prescribed burns if the relevant policy and staffing changes can be made,\" Swain said. The researchers also found regional variation in the changes. In California, for example, the changes are most pronounced in coastal and southern parts of the state, with many places losing a month of days suitable for prescribed fires each year. The northern parts of the Rocky Mountains, on the other hand, may see a modest increase in days when it's safe to use these fires. Yet not much will change in the short term, according to Swain. \"We're just not doing a lot of prescribed fire compared to what is needed, at scale, to really address the escalating wildfire crisis,\" he said. The study, published in Communications Earth and Environment , a Nature journal, included research from UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Merced and the Nature Conservancy. It focused on historical and projected climate conditions and vegetation dryness, comparing 1980-2020 with 2020-2060. The researchers did not address other factors important to the use of prescribed fire: impact on ecology, public policy considerations, effects of smoke on humans and wildlife, and availability of staff to do prescribed burns. As wildfires in the American West have dramatically increased for a variety of reasons -- including climate change, human development in fire-prone areas and aggressive fire suppression in the 20th century -- tools like prescribed fires will only become more critical. Anticipating future opportunities and limitations to the use of this tool enables agencies to plan ahead, particularly as regards the firefighting work force. \"This paper is giving us advanced warning,\" Shive said. \"Hopefully we can change policies to either extend those folks or create winter-specific crews.\""

    "context": "[DOC 0]\nWhen biomass such as crop residues, wood, or other organic matter is heated to produce clean energy and biochar, it also generates a thick liquid known as bio-tar. This tar easily clogs pipelines, damages equipment, and poses environmental risks if released into the atmosphere. For decades, researchers have sought ways to eliminate or neutralize it. Now, a team led by scientists at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences argues that instead of being treated as waste, bio-tar can be converted into \"bio-carbon\" -- a novel material with applications ranging from water purification to clean energy storage. \"Our review highlights how turning bio-tar into bio-carbon not only solves a technical problem for the bioenergy industry, but also opens the door to producing advanced carbon materials with high economic value,\" said senior author Dr. Zonglu Yao. The review examines how chemical reactions inside bio-tar, particularly those involving oxygen-rich compounds like carbonyls and furans, naturally promote polymerization -- processes where small molecules link together to form larger, more stable carbon structures. By carefully adjusting temperature, reaction time, and additives, researchers can harness this process to produce bio-carbon with tailored properties. The resulting material, the authors note, is distinct from ordinary biochar. Bio-carbon typically has higher carbon content, lower ash, and unique structural features that make it especially suited for advanced uses. Early studies suggest that bio-carbon could serve as: Importantly, recent economic and life-cycle assessments suggest that converting bio-tar into bio-carbon can deliver net-positive energy, financial, and environmental benefits. For example, replacing coal with bio-carbon fuels could cut carbon dioxide emissions by hundreds of millions of tons annually, while also generating profits for biomass processing plants. Still, challenges remain. The chemical complexity of bio-tar makes it difficult to fully control the polymerization process, and large-scale production has not yet been achieved. The authors recommend combining laboratory experiments with computer simulations and machine learning to optimize reaction pathways and design bio-carbon with specific functions. \"Bio-tar polymerization is not just about waste treatment -- it represents a new frontier for creating sustainable carbon materials,\" said first author Yuxuan Sun. \"With further research, this approach could significantly improve the efficiency of biomass energy systems while providing new tools for environmental protection and clean technology.\" The study provides a roadmap for scientists and industry partners to turn one of bioenergy's biggest obstacles into a powerful resource for the future."

    "context": "[DOC 66]\nA new study published in Communications Earth and Environment by UC Merced professors Adeyemi Adebiyi and John Abatzoglou finds that the Central Valley accounts for about 77% of fallowed land in California and is associated with about 88% of major anthropogenic, or human-caused, dust events. \"Idled farmland and dust are particularly concentrated in Kern, Fresno and Kings counties, where annual crops such as wheat, corn, and cotton are fallowed as part of agricultural practices or a combination of water and economic decisions,\" said Abatzoglou, a climatologist in the Department of Management of Complex Systems in the School of Engineering. \"When fields are unplanted, wind erosion can create dust.\" Dust can be laced with chemicals and pathogens that cause severe respiratory illnesses or death. For example, Valley fever, caused by a fungus, relies on dust to spread. Particulate matter has also been linked to various forms of dementia, cardiovascular problems, COPD, asthma, and perhaps surprisingly, longer and more painful menstrual cycles. Vulnerable groups disproportionately bear these health impacts. In addition to health problems, a significant reduction in visibility during dust storms has resulted in fatal traffic accidents. Dust storms can also reduce agricultural productivity due to the loss of fertile topsoil and abrasion of crops by airborne particles, which is particularly critical given the state's role as the leading agricultural producer in the United States. \"California, particularly the Central Valley, has not been considered an important dust source,\" said Adebiyi, who studies dust and its impacts as a member of the Department of Life and Environmental Sciences in the School of Natural Sciences and as an affiliate of the Health Sciences Research Institute. \"However, we're beginning to see, with recent events, that the Central Valley is a major contributor, and much of its dust comes from agricultural sources.\" Although researchers don't fully understand dust's effects on climate, they do know that when dust settles on the Sierra Nevada snowpack, it darkens the snow and encourages melting earlier in the year than usual. That impacts critical water resources for people around the state. Fallowed acreage varies year to year, but the researchers found that the geographic coverage of these unfarmed lands expanded between 2008 and 2022, and that growth could be linked to an increase in dust activities. Although it is common to rotate crops and idle lands regularly, the expansion of unplanted lands is partly due to the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, which requires farmers to limit the water they use yearly. \"The goal of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act is clearly to balance groundwater, which is important for California's future,\" Adebiyi said. \"However, there are unintended consequences to nearby communities, such as potential dust that comes from farmland fallowed due to SGMA, and what is crucial are those mitigation efforts that can reduce wind erosion.\" The researchers suggested farmers consider cover crops or ground cover that increases soil health and reduces dust. Widespread dust events are generally driven by weather, such as strong winds or storms, but dust becomes more likely when soil is dry and disturbed, the latter being human-caused, Abatzoglou said. Human activity, including construction and farming, heavily drives localized dust. Continued research, such as this study and another recent one that resulted in a report from a coalition called UC Dust, will help researchers better understand dust's impacts on a wide range of concerns and challenges. \"A better understanding of what likely dominates anthropogenic dust from agricultural sources may help us better represent the overall impacts of dust in other parts of the country and the world,\" Adebiyi said. One of the biggest unknowns in simulating climate and health impacts of dust in the future is how anthropogenic dust may change. \"Because our study points to fallowed or idled farmlands as a dominant contributor, that may change how we estimate overall dust impact,\" he said."

We need to figure out a way to fix it and make it work.\" Part of what made the Green Revolution so revolutionary was the invention of synthetic, nitrogen-heavy fertilizers that could keep agricultural yields high. But they're expensive to make, they create an enormous amount of carbon dioxide, and much of the fertilizer washes away. Most crops only use about 40-60% of the nitrogen applied to them, a measurement known as nitrogen use efficiency, or NUE, and the NUE of rice can be as low as 30% -- which means that 70% of what a farmer puts on their fields washes away into streams, lakes and the oceans, causing eutrophication, dead zones and a host of other environmental problems. It also means that 70% of the cost of the fertilizer is likewise wasted. Furthermore, when nitrogen is applied to soils, it interacts with the soil's incredibly complex chemistry and microbes, and ultimately leads to vastly increased amounts of methane, ammonia and nitrous oxide -- all of which contribute to global warming. Furthermore, synthesizing fertilizer itself is a greenhouse-gas-heavy enterprise. \"Everybody knows that we need to improve NUE,\" says Xing -- the question is how? What Xing and his co-authors, including lead author Chuanxi Wang and another senior author, Zhenyu Wang, professors of environmental processes and pollution control at Jiangnan University discovered, is that nanoscale selenium, an element crucial for plant and human health, when applied to the foliage and stems of the rice, reduced the negative environmental impacts of nitrogen fertilization by 41% and increased the economic benefits by 38.2% per ton of rice, relative to conventional practices. \"We used an aerial drone to lightly spray rice growing in a paddy with the suspension of nanoscale selenium,\" says Wang. \"That direct contact means that the rice plant is far more efficient at absorbing the selenium than it would be if we applied it to the soil.\" Selenium stimulates the plant's photosynthesis, which increased by more than 40%. Increased photosynthesis means the plant absorbs more CO 2 , which it then turns into carbohydrates. Those carbohydrates flow down into the plant's roots, which causes them to grow. Bigger, healthier roots release a host of organic compounds that cultivate beneficial microbes in the soil, and it's these microbes that then work symbiotically with the rice roots to pull more nitrogen and ammonium out of the soil and into the plant, increasing its NUE from 30 to 48.3%, decreasing the amount of nitrous oxide and ammonia release to the atmosphere by 18.8-45.6%. With more nutrients coming in, the rice itself produces a higher yield, with a more nutritious grain: levels of protein, certain critical amino acids, and selenium also jumped. On top of all of this, Xing, Wang and their colleagues found that their nano-selenium applications allowed farmers to reduce their nitrogen applications by 30%. Since rice cultivation accounts for 15-20% of the global nitrogen use, this new technique holds real promise for helping to meet the triple threat of growing population, climate change, and the rising economic and environmental costs of agriculture."

Damage assessments are typically conducted through field reconnaissance deployments, which can be labor-intensive, costly and risky. Moreover, field-based emergency response assessments can be hindered by delays and other setbacks due to the severity of the damage and the inability to access the hardest hit areas. Using remote sensing technology, Florida Atlantic University researchers have developed a novel technique that provides rapid, high-resolution assessments of detailed damage after a hurricane. Using aerial imagery data and LiDAR, they identified the hardest-hit areas of Southwest Florida's Estero Island and estimated the extent of structural damage. Researchers also compared pre- and post-storm structural or morphological changes to the beach. The study is the first to apply an advanced multi-faceted approach that links damage assessment to post-storm change in the structure of barrier islands. Results of the study, published in the Journal of Marine Science and Engineering , identified a total of 2,427 structures on Estero Island that were impacted by Hurricane Ian, with 170 structures suffering extensive damage. A single store was the only structure in the study area classified as \"not affected.\" Using data from the Lee County tax appraiser, researchers estimated the total assessed value of the heavily damaged structures at more than $200 million. Overall, 734 buildings had 30 to 50 percent structural damage, the majority of which were single-family and multi-unit residences. Researchers identified 158 buildings that were severely damaged with partial or complete roof failure. The highest percentage of damaged structures occurred on the central and northern portions of the island, where most of the structures were single-family and multi-family residences. Most of the structures that experienced 0 to 30 percent damage were classified as low-rise condominiums (three stories or less), commercial shopping centers and stores. Among the \"severely damaged\" and \"destroyed\" structures were seven mobile home subdivisions. \"Employing this advanced technology of aerial imagery and airborne LiDAR enabled us to collect extensive data from Hurricane Ian's aftermath and analyze large-scale datasets rather quickly,\" said Tiffany Roberts Briggs, Ph.D., senior author, chair and an associate professor in the Department of Geosciences within FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. The 2,427 structures were built between 1963 to 2019. The buildings in the areas where less damage was observed were built between 1963 and 1981. Similarly, in the areas of heavy damage, the majority of the buildings were built between 1963 and 1981. The spatial distribution of ground elevation and year built indicated no apparent trends associated with these two variables. \"We found no correlation between the ground elevation or year built for the extent of damages in this analysis, which emphasizes the role of the extreme inundation and importance of other factors contributing to vulnerability,\" said Roberts Briggs. \"Results from our study can help improve disaster planning by developing new policies and guidelines for coastal development in some of the most vulnerable and storm-exposed areas.\" Areas associated with little to no damage were spatially clustered in the southern and central portion of the island, with most structures concentrated on the landward side of the barrier island. \"The southern portion of Estero Island contains multiple saltwater marshes,\" said Leanne Hauptman, first author and a Ph.D. student in FAU's Department of Geosciences. \"Because of these saltwater marshes, storm-wave energy may been substantially dissipated by friction by the time the waves reached the barrier interior, potentially lessening the impact on the structures in that area.\" Findings also showed substantial post-storm debris and sand deposition across the entire island, and a notable deposition of sediment across the roadways and on the backside of the barrier, which is not readily returned seaward to the beach under post-storm conditions. Ponding water also was found hundreds of meters inland near buildings and other structures, providing evidence of the extent of inundation resulting from the storm. \"Although our study focused on Estero Island, this new remote sensing approach is generalizable,\" said Diana Mitsova, Ph.D., corresponding author, chair and professor, FAU Department of Urban and Regional Planning within the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science and an affiliate professor, FAU Department of Geosciences. \"As this technology continues to advance and becomes more readily available, it will offer a broad range of high-resolution coverage that can help prioritize emergency response efforts immediately following catastrophic natural disasters and other events.\" For the study, analysis of beach morphology was conducted by creating profile graphs to visualize elevation changes over a continuous distance. To measure structural damage, researchers use LiDAR tools to extract building footprints and building heights pre- and post-storm. Building footprints were overlaid on the post-imagery to estimate the total number of damaged buildings as well as the level of damage to each structure."

Climate change will increase the intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones in the region and raise sea levels, increasing salinity and threatening settlement in the most vulnerable areas. However, land level fluctuations are nothing new in this estuary, as the Sundarbans have been and continue to be shaped by the silt carried by rivers from the Himalayan mountains. Strips of land are constantly rising from the shore, while elsewhere they are being submerged. The report makes the following main recommendations for promoting sustainable development in mangrove forest areas: Regulation and control to shrimp farming The researchers recommend addressing many of the vulnerabilities of coastal communities. These include the uncontrolled expansion of shrimp farming that threatens the fragile ecosystem and livelihoods of the region. As shrimp farms are established on agricultural land, they are taking over from the most labour-intensive livelihoods, with mangrove forests among those areas being cleared for shrimp farms. The salty water that is piped into shrimp farms makes the land unsuitable for farming, while the chemicals used in the farms pollute the environment. The researchers also recommend regulation and control of shrimp farming. Instead of relocating populations, which is difficult to implement, they propose supporting environmentally friendly livelihoods in the area. An example of these would be freshwater harvesting and the associated fish farming and cultivation. On lands where the salinity levels are low it is possible to grow salt-tolerant crops. Many inhabitants already earn their living by harvesting forest products without damaging the forests. These livelihoods should not be discouraged in forest conservation. Ecotourism and agroforestry also offer sustainable livelihoods. Support schemes for residents should allow mobility, as many residents combine paid work in the city with their rural livelihoods. Storm shelters, floodwalls and levees to protect residents from storms Storm shelters, floodwalls and levees play a key role in protecting residents from storms. These vital infrastructures need to be maintained and managed in partnership with local communities. The corruption associated with infrastructure construction and the distribution of government benefits must be limited through monitoring and awareness-raising."

The phenomenon has accelerated in Australia over the last 40 years. \"The rise in salinity can be attributed to elevated temperatures, enhanced evaporation, reduced rain and freshwater inputs, and rising sea levels,\" says Dr Keneally, whose recent study was published in Earth-Science Reviews . \"Human factors such as upstream water diversions, urbanisation and development, and groundwater depletion also reduce freshwater inflow to coastal lagoons. \"We can mitigate the impacts of these activities by restoring environmental flows. Allocating water for the environment can maintain lagoon flushing, and nutrient runoff can be reduced by upgrading wastewater plants, re-establishing wetlands, and increasing efforts to retain nutrients in our agricultural lands throughout catchments worldwide. \"To buffer the effects of drought or sea-level rise, we could also re-open closed tidal inlets to improve mixing, or improving salt tolerant vegetation coverage to trap sediment and slow evaporation.\" A lagoon can bounce back surprisingly fast when appropriately flushed. After the record 2022 Murray-Darling floods, South Australia's Coorong Lagoon's microbiome shifted back toward its healthier, more diverse state within months, demonstrating that timely freshwater inputs can rapidly reverse 'salty soup' conditions. Addressing high salinity and nutrient pollution in lagoons benefits the ecosystems they serve while mitigating human health impacts. \"Fish kills hurt local fisheries, algae blooms may produce toxins or airborne irritants, and lost seagrass can weaken coastal flood protection,\" says Dr Keneally. \"Emerging research also suggests degradation can make these ecosystems a source of potent greenhouse emissions, adding to climate impacts felt well beyond the shoreline.\"\n\n[DOC 1713]\nThe study, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans , studied the effects of dams built in coastal estuaries, where rivers and ocean tides interact. Those massive infrastructure projects are surging in popularity globally, in part to help offset intensifying storms, salt intrusion and sea-level rise fueled by climate change. By analyzing data and measurements from Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, dating back more than a century, researchers determined that coastal dams don't necessarily mitigate flooding. Dams can either increase or decrease flood risks, depending on the duration of a surge event and friction from the flow of water. \"We usually think about storm surges becoming smaller as you go inland, but the shape of the basin can actually cause it to become larger,\" said lead author Steven Dykstra, an assistant professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences. Estuaries are typically shaped like a funnel, narrowing as they go inland. Introducing a dam shortens the estuary with an artificial wall that reflects storm surge waves moving inland. The narrowing channel shape also makes small reflections that change with the surge duration. Dykstra compared those storm-fueled waves to splashes in a bathtub, with certain wave frequencies causing water to slosh over the sides. After using Charleston Harbor as a case study, researchers used computer modeling to gauge the flood response at 23 other estuaries in diverse geographic areas. Those encompassed both dammed and naturally occurring estuary systems, including Cook Inlet in Alaska. The models confirmed that the basin shape and alterations that shorten it with a dam are the key component in determining how storm surges and tides move inland. At the right amplitude and duration, waves in dammed environments grow instead of diminishing. The study also determined that areas far from coastal dams could still be directly influenced by human-created infrastructure. In the Charleston area, the highest storm surges routinely occurred more than 50 miles inland. \"One of the scary things with this is that sometimes people don't realize they are in a coastal-influenced zone,\" Dykstra said. \"Sea-level rise is making people far inland aware that they're not free from coastal effects -- and it usually happens with a massive flood.\" Other contributors to the study included Enrica Viparelli, Alexander Yankovsky and Raymond Torres from the University of South Carolina, and Stefan Talke from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo."

What we see is not just noise or chaos,\" says Feinman. The variation that the researchers found challenges long-held views across history and the social sciences that we can use ancient Greece and Rome, or the medieval history of Europe as generalized representations of humanity's past. \"There are a lot of things that have been presumed for centuries -- for example, that inequality rises inevitably,\" says Feinman. \"The traditional thinking expects that once you get larger societies with formal leaders, or once you have farming, inequality is going to go way up. These ideas have been held for hundreds of years, and what we find is that it's more complicated than that -- high degrees of inequality are not inevitable in large societies. There are factors that may make it easier to happen or increase to high degrees, but these factors can be leveled off or modified by different human decisions and institutions.\" \"Variability in the sizes of houses may not be the full extent of wealth differences, but it's a consistent indicator of the degree of economic inequality that can be applied across time and space,\" says Feinman. \"I know from my own archaeological fieldwork in the Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico, that almost always, the larger the house, the more elaborate the house, with special features and thicker walls.\" To quantify and compare economic inequality in different places, at different points in history, the researchers used the variable distributions of house sizes at more than 1000 settlements to calculate a Gini coefficient for each site conducted statistical analyses in which they examined the relationship between the amount of inequality in a society and the political complexity of that society. The Gini coefficient is a commonly employed metric to assess inequality that ranges between 0 (complete equality) and 1 (maximal inequality).The coefficients for each locality were then compared across time and space to examine trends in inequality and assess how it varied in relation to population, political organization, and other potential causal factors. The investigators then looked at these trends in the Gini values in the context of the size of the sites that were compared and how complex the hierarchical structure of governance was. They found that even while populations have risen over the years, inequality hasn't always increased in a uniform way. \"The measure of inequality we found in these sites is quite variable, which suggests that there's not one homogenized pattern,\" says Feinman. In other words, contrary to traditional scholarly thinking, there's no one-size-fits-all explanation for why societies become economically unequal. \"Human choice and governance and cooperation have played a role in damping down inequality at certain times and places, and that is what accounts for this variability in time and space,\" says Feinman. \"And if inequality isn't inevitable when human aggregations get larger and governmental structures get more hierarchical, then there is a suite of implications for how we view the present and how we look at the past. Although history has shown us that elements of technology and population growth can raise the potential for inequality at certain times and places, that potential is not always realized, as people have implemented leveling mechanisms and systems of governance that mute that potential. The often-expressed views that certain economic, demographic, or technological conditions or factors make great wealth disparities inevitable simply are not borne out by our global past.\""

That's a big problem for officials working to understand where help is needed and to communicate effectively with people impacted by disasters, says Dr. Jose Ramirez-Marquez of the Stevens School of Systems and Enterprises. \"It's like being at a crowded party -- if everyone's arguing loudly about politics, it's hard to make yourself heard over the noise,\" he explains. Working with Stevens PhD candidate Yefang Liang, Dr. Ramirez-Marquez analyzed messages posted on X during each of four recent hurricanes -- Harvey, Imelda, Laura, and Florence -- and identified the clusters of tweets that attracted the most attention and engagement before, during, and after the storms. Their findings, published this week in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, show that in many cases the topics that generated the most intense online interest were completely unrelated to safety messaging or rescue work. During Hurricane Harvey, for instance, 24 of the 50 most active topics involved discussion of dogs affected by flooding. By contrast, just seven of the 50 most active topics involved public safety messages. \"That's obviously a problem if you're a public official trying to ensure people know how to keep themselves safe during a storm,\" Dr. Ramirez-Marquez says. Similar patterns played out during other storms, too. During Hurricane Florence, more than half of high-engagement topics involved either animal-related chatter or political arguments, while just 19 out of the top 50 topics involved rescue or public safety messages. During Hurricane Imelda, meanwhile, debates about climate change accounted for almost one-quarter of all high-engagement topics, drowning out higher-stakes safety messages. \"This really is zero-sum: if conversations about animals or politics are taking up all the oxygen, it's that much harder for other, potentially more important messages to break through,\" Dr. Ramirez-Marquez warns. The team's research does suggest some ways that officials can maximize the chances of safety messages reaching a broad audience. Descriptive messaging about storms tends to outperform safety messages, for instance -- so combining the two, and weaving public safety notifications or warnings into more descriptive social-media posts, might help to boost the reach of such messages. \"It's also important that officials stay focused during disasters, and don't inadvertently get drawn into political conversations that could distract from their core messaging,\" Dr. Ramirez-Marquez adds. The reality, though, is that using social media to support safety and recovery efforts in the wake of natural disasters will remain challenging, because many users enjoy engaging with content that doesn't serve a public safety function. To overcome that, social networks themselves would likely need to step in. Actively amplifying official disaster-related messaging for users in affected communities, for instance, might help ensure that such people get the information they need while still allowing users in other areas to chat freely about unrelated topics. More broadly, the study highlights the fragility of social-media communities. While the current study focused on the impact of harmless chatter, Dr. Ramirez-Marquez notes, bad actors can also deliberately hijack or distort online conversations by spreading enticing but false information. \"As we've seen in recent weeks, with the misinformation surrounding natural disasters in Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina, social networks remain highly vulnerable to misinformation,\" Dr. Ramirez-Marquez says. To remedy that, social networks could potentially work to create mechanisms that help users determine who to trust online, or that make it easier to filter out distracting or false information during disasters. \"The key here is that the networks themselves will need to take the lead on rebuilding trust online,\" Dr. Ramirez-Marquez says. \"This isn't a problem that government officials can solve on their own.\""

    "context": "[DOC 2015]\nThe new study was led by experts at Newcastle University and the Met Office and investigated how future climate change may influence compound wind-rain extremes, which are events where extreme wind and rainfall occur simultaneously. The researchers analysed data from climate simulations covering control (1981-2000) and future (2060-2081) periods, to assess potential changes in these extreme events. Their findings show that, as the climate warms, these events are likely to become more severe, with stronger winds and heavier rainfall happening together. These changes are mainly driven by increased rainfall, a thermodynamic response to rising temperatures. Additional contributing factors include a strengthened jet stream and its southward displacement that brings storms through warmer areas leading to further increases in rainfall. Publishing their findings in the journal Weather and Climate Extremes, the scientists show that the increase in intensity could lead to more frequent windstorms coinciding with extreme rainfall and floods, posing challenges to coastal areas susceptible to compound flooding as well as emergency response resources due to larger aggregation of separate impacts to infrastructure such as electricity networks and rail transport networks. Study lead author, Dr Colin Manning, Research Associate at Newcastle University's School of Engineering and Visiting Scientist, Met Office, Hadley Centre, said: \"Our work shows that such compound extremes will occur more frequently as our climate warms and likely bring more severe impacts, and a higher aggregation of separate damages arising from wind and flooding which may stretch emergency response resources. Avoiding the worst of these impacts will require cutting our greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the resilience of our infrastructure.\" The team used a number of methods to analyse compound wind-rain extremes and their future changes. They used an event-based analysis based on the occurrence of an extra-tropical cyclone (ETC) over the UK and Ireland. By linking extreme wind and rainfall events to these systems, the scientists assessed their severity using Wind Severity Index (WSI) and Rainfall Severity Index (RSI). Return periods (RPs) were estimated for both individual and joint extremes, indicating their likelihood, while the team categorised events based on their wind and rainfall characteristics. In addition, the researchers identified local co-occurrences of extreme wind gusts and rainfall to understand their changing intensity contributions in future simulations. Professor Lizzie Kendon, Head of Understanding Climate Change at the Met Office and co-author on the paper, said: \"This work exploits the latest high resolution climate projections for the UK, UKCP Local, where the Met Office weather forecast model has been run to give 100-y long climate projections at km-scale. These are providing new insights into how the UK climate may change at the very local scale, and how changes in weather extremes may be realised over the coming years and decades. This is highlighting the importance of considering compounding effects, including co-occurrences of different hazards, as well as the clustering of extreme events, in fully capturing the potential impacts of climate change.\" This research sets the stage for further investigation into the mechanisms driving compound wind-rain extremes. Future research will need to consider a greater range of climate models to understand if the results are robust across different models. Research is also required to understand and quantify the link between these compound extremes and the resultant impacts which would help stakeholders better understand their risk and choose the most cost-effective adaptations to reduce risks.

    "context": "[DOC 72]\nHigher temperatures, more frequent and longer droughts, catastrophic rainfall events and rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels all influence the growth, development and reproductive viability of crop plants, he writes. While some plants and regions may benefit from some aspects of climate change, without prolonged and costly intervention, many more will suffer potentially catastrophic declines. \"By 2050-60, crops will experience a significantly different environment from today,\" Long writes. From its pre-industrial level of about 200 parts per million, \"atmospheric CO 2 reached 427 ppm in 2024 and is projected to be about 600 ppm by 2050.\" Extreme heat, droughts, floods and other climate-related events are already disrupting agricultural systems. Projected temperature extremes and climate instability will further reduce crop yields, increasing starvation, political unrest and mass migration, he writes. There is some hope, however. It may be possible to alter crops in ways that allow them to persist and perhaps even increase yields despite the challenges, Long said. While the process takes time and can be costly, the work has already begun. For example, researchers are evaluating the heat-, drought- and flood-tolerance of different varieties of specific crop plants, identifying those with potentially beneficial attributes. Discovering the genetic traits that confer these benefits will allow scientists to develop crops -- through plant breeding and/or genetic engineering -- that can better withstand the extremes. Through painstaking work, scientists have discovered that some rice varieties can survive up to two weeks of submergence during periods of intense flooding, while other varieties are more heat tolerant than others. The findings offer opportunities to develop hardier cultivars. Plants must withstand an array of challenges as temperatures rise. The drying capacity of the atmosphere, which increases with temperature, draws moisture out of plant leaves through tiny pores called stomata. This reduces plant water-use efficiency, Long said, straining already scarce water resources in many parts of the globe. \"A plant may partially close its stomata to retain moisture, but this can interfere with its ability to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a key step in photosynthesis,\" Long said. In laboratory and field experiments, researchers found that increasing the expression of the gene for a sensor protein found in plants reduced water loss through stomata without interfering with photosynthesis. \"The result was a 15% improvement in leaf-level water-use efficiency in field-grown tobacco and a 30% decrease in whole plant water use,\" Long wrote. Because of the high speed with which it can be genetically modified, tobacco is often used as a \"test-bed\" for studying alterations that can be used in a variety of other plants. Researchers also have found ways to reduce the density of stomata on the leaves of rice and wheat, improving water-use efficiency by 15-20% with no decrease in yield. High carbon dioxide on its own alters plant physiology, sometimes in beneficial ways by boosting photosynthesis, but also in detrimental ways, Long said. High CO 2 can change plant metabolic control by altering levels of key enzymes. Scientists have found that adjusting the levels of proteins that regulate rubisco, a key photosynthetic enzyme, can boost photosynthetic efficiency in the presence of high CO 2 . To demonstrate what kinds of gains are possible in food crops, Long points to the remarkable progress made in research on maize, nearly 80% of which is used in ethanol production and to feed animals, not humans. \"Between 1980 and 2024, U.S. maize yields doubled while sorghum improved just 12%,\" he said. The success in maize is the result of massive investments from large multinational companies. The same investments are not yet being made on the public domain side of the equation. Without similar investment, \"it is hard to see how the opportunities â€¦ for future-proofing our crops can be implemented at the scale that is necessary,\" he writes. Long also is a professor in the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at the U. of I.

The authors of the article are the experts Olmo Miguez Salas, from the Faculty of Earth Sciences at the University of Barcelona, and Zekun Wang, from the Natural History Museum in London (United Kingdom). Fossil traces of extinct animals The Cambrian explosion is a unique period in the history of life that poses many unanswered questions. To delve into the biodiversity of this period, most studies in paleontology tend to focus on the study of organisms that had hard parts. However, the study of trace fossils (or ichnofossils) opens up the possibility of discovering what the activity of hard-bodied, soft-bodied or skeletally deficient organisms preserved in the stratigraphic record was like. \"The trace fossil record provides valuable information about evolutionary periods when soft-bodied fauna were dominant,\" says Olmo Miguez Salas, a Beatriu de PinÃ³s postdoctoral researcher at the UB's Department of Earth and Ocean Dynamics. \"Fossil traces reflect the behavior of the organism that generates them, which is determined by habitat and responses to environmental stimuli. Therefore, they are an indicator of the paleoecological conditions in which the organisms that generated them lived.\" The authors have focused on the study of trace fossils in the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition, \"a period of recognized paleoevolutionary interest that was a turning point in the evolution of complex life on Earth,\" says Miguez Salas. In this transition, there was a radical change in biodiversity and in the structure of organisms and ecosystems. \"The Ediacaran fauna was dominated by complex, multicellular soft-bodied organisms. The transition to the Cambrian involved the extinction of much of the Ediacara fauna, and a rapid diversification of complex multicellular life forms with hard parts (e.g. exoskeletons). This is the evolutionary core from which most modern animal phyla emerged: what is known as the Cambrian explosion,\" notes the researcher. The Cambrian explosion may have happened much earlier The study published in Geology quantitatively indicates that organisms with slender body profiles thrived around 545 million years ago. \"These organisms probably possessed coelomic hydrostatic bodies, with an anteroposterior axis, muscles and possibly segmentation,\" the expert says. \"Furthermore, these organisms could move in a specific direction (directional locomotion) and probably possessed sensory capabilities to move and feed on heterogeneous substrates in a habitat dominated by microbial mats. Therefore, the so-called Cambrian explosion and its evolutionary implications may have occurred much earlier than estimated.\" These adaptations in body profile and mobility allowed these early animals to thrive in increasingly dynamic and complex environments, an ecological engineering that could promote evolutionary innovations. The methodology of the study was based on the analysis of the linear proportionality exhibited by the trace trajectories of modern and fossilized animals. Subsequently, this scaling law has been applied to locomotor traces of Ediacaran-Cambrian fossils (e.g. Archaeonassa , Gordia , Helminthopsis and Parapsammichnites ). Although some previous studies had described trace fossils associated with mobile benthic bilateral organisms in the Ediacara fauna, detailed quantitative approaches were lacking and there were still many unknowns about the body shape of these organisms (length, width, cephalization, etc.). The findings of the new study establish an innovative quantitative approach to analysing the fossil locomotion traces from ancient times, early animal anatomy and paleoecological dynamics. \"This new discovery opens the door to quantitatively study future Ediacara trace fossils discovered in the coming years and to corroborate that the Cambrian explosion did not happen in the Cambrian, but many millions of years earlier. Moreover, the scaling laws obtained in this study enable the study of the morphological evolution of different faunal phyla generating fossil locomotion traces, not only during this evolutionary period, but also during other evolutionary periods of similar importance, such as the great diversification event of the Ordovician,\" concludes Olmo Miguez Salas. â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹"

    "context": "[DOC 21]\nResearchers from the University of Utah, New York University and Stanford University are now demonstrating the potential for another option: gait retraining. By making a small adjustment to the angle of their foot while walking, participants in a year-long randomized control trial experienced pain relief equivalent to medication. Critically, those participants also showed less knee cartilage degradation over that period as compared to a group that received a placebo treatment. Published in The Lancet Rheumatology and co-led by Scott Uhlrich of Utah's John and Marcia Price College of Engineering, these findings come from the first placebo-controlled study to demonstrate the effectiveness of a biomechanical intervention for osteoarthritis. \"We've known that for people with osteoarthritis, higher loads in their knee accelerate progression, and that changing the foot angle can reduce knee load,\" said Uhlrich, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering. \"So the idea of a biomechanical intervention is not new, but there have not been randomized, placebo-controlled studies to show that they're effective.\" With support from the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies, the researchers were specifically looking at patients with mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis in the medial compartment of the knee -- on the inside of the leg -- which tends to bear more weight than the lateral, outside, compartment. This form of osteoarthritis is the most common, but the ideal foot angle for reducing load in the medial side of the knee differs from person to person depending on their natural gait and how it changes when they adopt the new walking pattern. \"Previous trials prescribed the same intervention to all individuals, resulting in some individuals not reducing, or even increasing, their joint loading,\" Uhlrich said. \"We used a personalized approach to selecting each individual's new walking pattern, which improved how much individuals could offload their knee and likely contributed to the positive effect on pain and cartilage that we saw.\" In their first two visits, participants received a baseline MRI and practiced walking on a pressure-sensitive treadmill while motion-capture cameras recorded the mechanics of their gait. This allowed the researchers to determine whether turning the patient's toe inward or outward would reduce load more, and whether a 5Â° or 10Â° adjustment would be ideal. This personalized analysis also screened out potential participants who could not benefit from the intervention, as none of the foot angle changes could decrease loading in their knees. These participants were included in previous studies, which may have contributed to those studies' inconclusive pain results. Moreover, after their initial intake sessions, half of the 68 participants were assigned to a sham treatment group to control for the placebo effect. These participants were prescribed foot angles that were actually identical to their natural gait. Conversely, participants in the intervention group were prescribed the change in foot angle that maximally reduced their knee loading. Participants from both groups returned to the lab for six weekly training sessions, where they received biofeedback -- vibrations from a device worn on the shin -- that helped them maintain the prescribed foot angle while walking on the lab's treadmill. After the six-week training period, participants were encouraged to practice their new gait for at least 20 minutes a day, to the point where it became natural. Periodic check-in visits showed that participants were adhering to their prescribed foot angle within a degree on average. After a year, all participants self-reported their experience of knee pain and had a second MRI to quantitatively assess the damage to their knee cartilage. \"The reported decrease in pain over the placebo group was somewhere between what you'd expect from an over-the-counter medication, like ibuprofen, and a narcotic, like oxycontin,\" Uhlrich said. \"With the MRIs, we also saw slower degradation of a marker of cartilage health in the intervention group, which was quite exciting.\" Beyond the quantitative measures of effectiveness, participants in the study expressed enthusiasm for both the approach and the results. One participant said: \"I don't have to take a drug or wear a deviceâ€¦it's just a part of my body now that will be with me for the rest of my days, so that I'm thrilled with.\" Participants' ability to adhere to the intervention over long periods of time is one of its potential advantages. \"Especially for people in their 30's, 40's, or 50's, osteoarthritis could mean decades of pain management before they're recommended for a joint replacement,\" Uhrlich said. \"This intervention could help fill that large treatment gap.\" Before this intervention can be clinically deployed, the gait retraining process will need to be streamlined. The motion-capture technique used to make the original foot angle prescription is expensive and time-consuming; the researchers envision this intervention to eventually be prescribed in a physical therapy clinic and retraining can happen while people go for a walk around their neighborhood. \"We and others have developed technology that could be used to both personalize and deliver this intervention in a clinical setting using mobile sensors, like smartphone video and a 'smart shoe',\" Uhlrich said. Future studies of this approach are needed before the intervention can be made widely available to the public."

Nearly twice the size of the human genome, the sequence was assembled from scratch and improves on an earlier draft assembly of the vigorous grass pea line LS007. \"We want to establish this new genome sequence as the reference genome for the grass pea community, and we're delighted to share this valuable resource for other scientists to use and learn about grass pea,\" explained corresponding author of the research Dr Peter Emmrich, a researcher at Norwich Institute for Sustainable Development (NISD) and visiting group leader at the John Innes Centre. \"At a time of increasing weather shocks, this genome allows us to unlock the secrets of grass pea's resilience, to further improve this crop for farmers, and inform development of other crops, such as peas,\" he added. Improvements in genome accuracy and completeness also allow researchers to study evolutionary links between species, helping identify gene pathways that could be used to improve the crop or to understand its remarkable drought tolerance. Dr Anne Edwards, research assistant at the John Innes Centre, said: \"As we prepare for a future of increased climate change, we are going to need crops that can cope with drought, or flooding or inundations of salt water. This new genome sequence means that we are even closer to adding grass pea to the list of climate-smart crops of tomorrow. It's an exciting time to be in the grass pea research community!\" What is Grass Pea? Grass pea is a crop grown in many regions of the world that is high in protein and resilient to drought and flooding. One of the oldest known cultivated plants, grass pea is now grown in Ethiopia, Eritrea, India, Bangladesh, and Nepal. It has been used for centuries as an insurance crop, that survives when other crops fail and is safe to eat as part of a balanced diet. Grass pea is among a group neglected and underutilised crops that play a key role in local nutrition and livelihoods, but that historically have received little attention from breeders and researchers. However, its resilience to both drought and flooding makes it a promising crop for ensuring food security in a changing climate. Grass pea's widespread cultivation has been hampered due to a toxin contained within its seeds and shoots, which can, in malnourished people, cause the disease neurolathyrism, a condition which causes irreversible paralysis. Another major barrier preventing crop breeding improvements was the lack of a genome reference for the crop. The availability of the new genome sequence means researchers could use gene editing and modern breeding methods to develop varieties of grass pea with improved agronomic characteristics or low or zero toxin content. This means that grass pea could be poised to make an important contribution to a more diversified and climate resilient food system in the future."

These conditions limit the opportunities. Now, a new study led by UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain has found that that climate change is further reducing the overall number of days and changing the times of year when prescribed fires can be safely used. Currently, scientists project warming of 2.0 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2060 -- a projection Swain called \"optimistic\" given the current trajectory of even greater warming. Still, these temperatures would reduce the number of days when weather and vegetation conditions favor prescribed fires by 17% on average across the Western U.S. Most reductions would come in spring and summer, when most prescribed burns are currently implemented. Yet in winter, the research projects a net 4% increase in the number of favorable days for prescribed fire. Paper co-author Kristen Shive, a UC Berkeley expert on forests, wildfires and prescribed fire, said specific burn prescriptions vary by location and vegetation type, but target temperatures commonly range from 50-70 degrees Fahrenheit with 10-20% relative humidity. Climate change will require the agencies responsible for prescribed burns to adjust, Swain said, because most personnel who prepare for and manage prescribed fires are seasonal workers whose jobs end by mid-autumn each year. Going forward, the use of prescribed fires will require changes in staff availability. \"Global warming will reduce the number of favorable days for prescribed fires throughout the American West, but winter in particular may emerge as an increasingly favorable time for prescribed burns if the relevant policy and staffing changes can be made,\" Swain said. The researchers also found regional variation in the changes. In California, for example, the changes are most pronounced in coastal and southern parts of the state, with many places losing a month of days suitable for prescribed fires each year. The northern parts of the Rocky Mountains, on the other hand, may see a modest increase in days when it's safe to use these fires. Yet not much will change in the short term, according to Swain. \"We're just not doing a lot of prescribed fire compared to what is needed, at scale, to really address the escalating wildfire crisis,\" he said.

As wildfires in the American West have dramatically increased for a variety of reasons -- including climate change, human development in fire-prone areas and aggressive fire suppression in the 20th century -- tools like prescribed fires will only become more critical. Anticipating future opportunities and limitations to the use of this tool enables agencies to plan ahead, particularly as regards the firefighting work force. \"This paper is giving us advanced warning,\" Shive said. \"Hopefully we can change policies to either extend those folks or create winter-specific crews.\""

Titan is the only planetary body in the solar system besides Earth that has liquid currently flowing across its surface, so its deltas could be a scientific treasure trove. One problem: Titan appears to be largely devoid of deltas, a new study finds, despite its large rivers of liquid methane and ethane. \"It's kind of disappointing as a geomorphologist because deltas should preserve so much of Titan's history,\" said Sam Birch, an assistant professor in Brown University's Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences who led the work. But the absence of deltas raises a host of new questions. \"We take it for granted that if you have rivers and sediments, you get deltas,\" Birch said. \"But Titan is weird. It's a playground for studying processes we thought we understood.\" Titan is the largest of Saturn's 274 confirmed moons. Its thick nitrogen and methane atmosphere gives rise to a host of Earth-like climate and weather features. Titan has clouds, wind and rain as well as rivers, lakes and seas. But instead of water, Titan's fluid bodies contain methane and ethane, which are liquid at Titan's chilly surface temperatures. Scientists learned of Titan's liquid bodies when the Cassini spacecraft flew by in 2006. Peering through Titan's thick atmosphere with Cassini's synthetic aperture radar (SAR), the spacecraft revealed spidering channels and large flat areas consistent with large bodies of liquid. Largely missing from Cassini's SAR images, however, were deltas -- even at the mouths of large rivers. It wasn't clear, however, whether the deltas were truly absent, or whether they just didn't show up in Cassini's SAR data. That's the question Birch and his colleagues tried to answer with this new study, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets. The problem with Cassini's SAR data is that shallow liquid methane is largely transparent in any images. So while the SAR images could see the broad seas and river channels, it's harder to confidently make out coastal features because it's difficult to see where the coast ends and where the sea floor begins. For the study, Birch developed a numerical model to simulate what Cassini's SAR would see if it looked at a landscape scientists understand well: Earth. In the model, the water in Earth's rivers and oceans was replaced by Titan's methane liquid, which has different radar absorption properties compared to water. \"We basically made synthetic SAR images of Earth that assume properties of Titan's liquid instead of Earth's,\" Birch said. \"Once we see SAR images of a landscape we know very well, we can go back to Titan and understand a bit better what we're looking at.\" The research found that the synthetic SAR images of Earth clearly resolved large deltas and many other large coastal landscapes. \"If there are deltas the size of the one at the mouth of the Mississippi River, we should be able to see it,\" Birch said. \"If there are large barrier islands and similar coastal landscapes like those we see all along the U.S. Gulf Coast, we should be able to see those.\" But when Birch and his colleagues combed over the Titan images in light of their new analysis, they came up mostly empty. Aside from two probable deltas near Titan's south pole, the rest of the moon's rivers were entirely delta-free. The researchers found that only about 1.3% of Titan's large rivers that terminate at coastlines have deltas. On Earth, in contrast, nearly every river of similar size has a delta. It's not entirely clear why Titan generally lacks deltas, Birch says. The fluid properties of Titan's rivers should make them perfectly capable of carrying and depositing sediment. It could be, the researchers say, that sea levels on Titan rise and fall so rapidly that deltas are smeared across the landscape more quickly than they can be built up in a single spot. Winds and tidal currents along Titan's coasts may also play an equally large role in preventing delta formation. And missing deltas aren't the only mystery raised by the new research. The new analysis of Cassini SAR data of Titan's coasts revealed pits of unknown origin deep within lakes and seas. The study also found deep channels on the floors of the seas that seem to have been carved by river flows, but it's not clear how they got there. All of these surprises will require more research to fully understand, Birch says. \"This is really not what we expected,\" Birch said. \"But Titan does this to us a lot. I think that's what makes it such an engaging place to study.\""

Now, a team led by scientists at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences argues that instead of being treated as waste, bio-tar can be converted into \"bio-carbon\" -- a novel material with applications ranging from water purification to clean energy storage. \"Our review highlights how turning bio-tar into bio-carbon not only solves a technical problem for the bioenergy industry, but also opens the door to producing advanced carbon materials with high economic value,\" said senior author Dr. Zonglu Yao. The review examines how chemical reactions inside bio-tar, particularly those involving oxygen-rich compounds like carbonyls and furans, naturally promote polymerization -- processes where small molecules link together to form larger, more stable carbon structures. By carefully adjusting temperature, reaction time, and additives, researchers can harness this process to produce bio-carbon with tailored properties. The resulting material, the authors note, is distinct from ordinary biochar. Bio-carbon typically has higher carbon content, lower ash, and unique structural features that make it especially suited for advanced uses. Early studies suggest that bio-carbon could serve as: Importantly, recent economic and life-cycle assessments suggest that converting bio-tar into bio-carbon can deliver net-positive energy, financial, and environmental benefits. For example, replacing coal with bio-carbon fuels could cut carbon dioxide emissions by hundreds of millions of tons annually, while also generating profits for biomass processing plants. Still, challenges remain. The chemical complexity of bio-tar makes it difficult to fully control the polymerization process, and large-scale production has not yet been achieved. The authors recommend combining laboratory experiments with computer simulations and machine learning to optimize reaction pathways and design bio-carbon with specific functions. \"Bio-tar polymerization is not just about waste treatment -- it represents a new frontier for creating sustainable carbon materials,\" said first author Yuxuan Sun. \"With further research, this approach could significantly improve the efficiency of biomass energy systems while providing new tools for environmental protection and clean technology.\" The study provides a roadmap for scientists and industry partners to turn one of bioenergy's biggest obstacles into a powerful resource for the future."

Shorelines along the north shore and east side of OÊ»ahu that are backed with hard-armoring, such as seawalls, could experience total beach loss.\" To create erosion predictions, the team of researchers used a computer model that incorporates about thirty years of satellite imagery, as well as aerial and drone imagery. The new model also directly accounts for the seasonal movement of sand. For example, when large swells arrive in the winter on OÊ»ahu's north shore, sand is transported from one part of the beach to another. Given prior modeling efforts, the team's own survey observations, and anecdotal evidence from residents, the researchers expected to see erosion predicted for many sandy beaches around OÊ»ahu. \"By including additional satellite data and seasonal modeling, our forecasts show that erosion will increase by nearly 44% above our previous estimates in the short-term, meaning that we anticipate more severe erosion sooner,\" said Moskvichev.

We need to figure out a way to fix it and make it work.\" Part of what made the Green Revolution so revolutionary was the invention of synthetic, nitrogen-heavy fertilizers that could keep agricultural yields high. But they're expensive to make, they create an enormous amount of carbon dioxide, and much of the fertilizer washes away. Most crops only use about 40-60% of the nitrogen applied to them, a measurement known as nitrogen use efficiency, or NUE, and the NUE of rice can be as low as 30% -- which means that 70% of what a farmer puts on their fields washes away into streams, lakes and the oceans, causing eutrophication, dead zones and a host of other environmental problems. It also means that 70% of the cost of the fertilizer is likewise wasted. Furthermore, when nitrogen is applied to soils, it interacts with the soil's incredibly complex chemistry and microbes, and ultimately leads to vastly increased amounts of methane, ammonia and nitrous oxide -- all of which contribute to global warming. Furthermore, synthesizing fertilizer itself is a greenhouse-gas-heavy enterprise. \"Everybody knows that we need to improve NUE,\" says Xing -- the question is how? What Xing and his co-authors, including lead author Chuanxi Wang and another senior author, Zhenyu Wang, professors of environmental processes and pollution control at Jiangnan University discovered, is that nanoscale selenium, an element crucial for plant and human health, when applied to the foliage and stems of the rice, reduced the negative environmental impacts of nitrogen fertilization by 41% and increased the economic benefits by 38.2% per ton of rice, relative to conventional practices. \"We used an aerial drone to lightly spray rice growing in a paddy with the suspension of nanoscale selenium,\" says Wang. \"That direct contact means that the rice plant is far more efficient at absorbing the selenium than it would be if we applied it to the soil.\" Selenium stimulates the plant's photosynthesis, which increased by more than 40%. Increased photosynthesis means the plant absorbs more CO 2 , which it then turns into carbohydrates. Those carbohydrates flow down into the plant's roots, which causes them to grow. Bigger, healthier roots release a host of organic compounds that cultivate beneficial microbes in the soil, and it's these microbes that then work symbiotically with the rice roots to pull more nitrogen and ammonium out of the soil and into the plant, increasing its NUE from 30 to 48.3%, decreasing the amount of nitrous oxide and ammonia release to the atmosphere by 18.8-45.6%. With more nutrients coming in, the rice itself produces a higher yield, with a more nutritious grain: levels of protein, certain critical amino acids, and selenium also jumped. On top of all of this, Xing, Wang and their colleagues found that their nano-selenium applications allowed farmers to reduce their nitrogen applications by 30%. Since rice cultivation accounts for 15-20% of the global nitrogen use, this new technique holds real promise for helping to meet the triple threat of growing population, climate change, and the rising economic and environmental costs of agriculture."

This requires that the plant world is able to acquire enough energy through photosynthesis to maintain the material flows of carbon, water and nitrogen that support the ecosystems and their many networked processes, despite today's massive human interference. Together with biodiversity loss and climate change, functional integrity forms the core of the Planetary Boundaries analytical framework for a safe operating space for humanity. \"There is an enormous need for civilization to utilize the biosphere - for food, raw materials and, in future, also for climate protection,\" says Fabian Stenzel, lead author of the study and member of the PIK research group Terrestrial Safe Operating Space. \"After all, human demand for biomass continues to grow - and on top of that, the cultivation of fast-growing grasses or trees for producing bioenergy with carbon capture and storage is considered by many to be an important supporting strategy for stabilizing climate. It is therefore becoming even more important to quantify the strain we're already putting on the biosphere - in a regionally differentiated manner and over time - to identify overloads. Our research is paving the way for this.\" Two indicators to measure the strain and the risk The study builds on the latest update of the Planetary Boundaries framework published in 2023. \"The framework now squarely puts energy flows from photosynthesis in the world's vegetation at the center of those processes that co-regulate planetary stability,\" explains Wolfgang Lucht, head of PIK's Earth System Analysis department and coordinator of the study. \"These energy flows drive all of life - but humans are now diverting a sizeable fraction of them to their own purposes, disturbing nature's dynamic processes.\" The stress this causes in the Earth system can be measured by the proportion of natural biomass productivity that humanity channels into its own uses - through harvested crops, residues and timber - but also the reduction in photosynthetic activity caused by land cultivation and sealing. The study added to this measure a second powerful indicator of biosphere integrity: An indicator of risk of ecosystem destabilization records complex structural changes in vegetation and in the biosphere's water, carbon and nitrogen balances. Europe, Asia and North America particularly affected Based on the global biosphere model LPJmL, which simulates water, carbon and nitrogen flows on a daily basis at a resolution of half a degree of longitude/latitude, the study provides a detailed inventory for each individual year since the 1600, based on changes in climate and human land use. The research team not only computed, mapped and compared the two indicators for functional integrity of the biosphere, but also evaluated them by conducting a mathematical comparison with other measures from the literature for which \"critical thresholds\" are known. This resulted in each area being assigned a status based on local tolerance limits of ecosystem change: Safe Operating Space, Zone of Increasing Risk or High Risk Zone. The model calculation shows that worrying developments began as early as 1600 in the mid- latitudes. By 1900, the proportion of global land area where ecosystem changes went beyond the locally defined safe zone, or were even in the high-risk zone, was 37 and 14 percent respectively, compared to the 60 and 38 percent we see today. Industrialization was beginning to take its toll; land use affected the state of the Earth system much earlier than climate warming. At present, this biosphere boundary has been transgressed on almost all land surface - primarily in Europe, Asia and North America - that underwent strong land cover conversion, mainly due to agriculture. PIK Director RockstrÃ¶m: Impetus for international climate policy \"This first world map showing the overshoot of the boundary for functional integrity of the biosphere, depicting both human appropriation of biomass and ecological disruption, is a breakthrough from a scientific perspective, offering a better overall understanding of planetary boundaries,\" says Johan RockstrÃ¶m, PIK Director and one of the co-authors of the study. \"It also provides an important impetus for the further development of international climate policy. This is because it points to the link between biomass and natural carbon sinks, and how they can contribute to mitigating climate change. Governments must treat it as a single overarching issue: comprehensive biosphere protection together with strong climate action.\""

    "context": "[DOC 2040]\n\"Coastal management strategies intended to protect people, property and infrastructure from storm impacts can, over decades, increase vulnerability, even leading to the loss of barrier islands, especially as sea-level rise rates increase,\" said A. Brad Murray, professor of geomorphology and coastal processes at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment. He and other researchers in North Carolina created a computer model that simulates dynamics of barrier island systems over the next two centuries, showing how natural processes that create and maintain these systems affect communities and infrastructure, and how human efforts to protect communities and infrastructure, in turn, affect those natural processes. They published a pair of studies on the work April 9, 2024 in Earth Futures. Barrier islands are narrow offshore landforms that run parallel to the mainland coastline. These are dynamic features, naturally gaining elevation and migrating landward as sea level rises or sediment supply dwindles. Barrier islands absorb wave energy before waves hit the mainland, which can lessen coastal storm surge and flooding. The United States has the greatest extent of barriers worldwide, stretching across much of the Southeast and Gulf of Mexico. Coastal communities on barrier islands, which have long grappled with eroding shorelines and coastal storms, now face substantial sea-level rise due to climate change. They are already encountering increased risks of coastal flooding and threats to critical infrastructure. Many of these coastal communities rely on federally subsidized \"beach nourishment\" -- the artificial widening of beaches with sand -- or engineered solutions, such as the construction of artificially high dunes, to adapt to changing climate threats. Some of these solutions, however, interrupt natural processes that have kept barriers above sea level. Sand deposited on these islands when storm waves knock down dunes is essential to maintain barriers' width and elevation. But on developed barriers, storm fallout -- including overwashed sand on roads -- are hazards. \"Counterintuitively, the more successful humans are in preventing storm impacts, the less resilient the barrier system becomes in the long term,\" said co-author, Laura Moore, professor of coastal geomorphology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"Difficult tradeoffs are going to be inevitable when it comes to managing the coast with the hope of preserving coastal living as we know it.\" The researchers' modelling demonstrates that how long a barrier remains habitable varies with different coastal management strategies and climate scenarios. For example, the model showed that shifting away from the practices of protecting roads with tall dunes and bulldozing overwashed sand off paved surfaces may allow barriers that would have become uninhabitable to rebound and keep up with sea level rise longer. Adopting management strategies that allow one segment of the shoreline to evolve naturally -- such as building a long bridge to replace part of a highway -- can increase the barrier system's resilience in that area. However, management strategies in one area affect erosion rates in adjacent areas. Increasing long-term resilience in one area can come at the cost of higher shoreline stabilization costs for neighboring communities. Given these connections along the shore, stakeholders in neighboring coastal areas may benefit from collaborating, the authors noted. \"There's no perfect solution,\" said the study's lead author, Katherine Anarde, assistant professor of coastal engineering at North Carolina State University. \"Understanding an entire barrier system and how it responds to different coastal management decisions is critical to assessing the sustainability of coastal development over the coming decades. The model helps us consider several factors in managing coastal areas to ensure we're not unintentionally making things worse in the long run, and to weigh the tradeoffs.\" The National Science Foundation, University of Virginia, and the Gulf Research Program Early-Career Research Fellowship co-funded this study."

    "context": "[DOC 2706]\nThe researchers report in Physical Review Letters that dark matter could have formed in the early life of the universe from the collision of high-energy massless particles that lost their zip and took on an incredible amount of mass immediately after pairing up, according to their mathematical models. While hypothetical, dark matter is believed to exist based on observed gravitational effects that cannot be explained by visible matter. Scientists estimate that 85% of the universe's total mass is dark matter. But the study authors write that their theory is distinct because it can be tested using existing observational data. The extremely low-energy particles they suggest make up dark matter would have a unique signature on the Cosmic Microwave Background, or CMB, the leftover radiation from the Big Bang that fills all of the universe. \"Dark matter started its life as near-massless relativistic particles, almost like light,\" says Robert Caldwell, a professor of physics and astronomy and the paper's senior author. \"That's totally antithetical to what dark matter is thought to be -- it is cold lumps that give galaxies their mass,\" Caldwell says. \"Our theory tries to explain how it went from being light to being lumps.\" Hot, fast-moving particles dominated the cosmos after the burst of energy known as the Big Bang that scientists believe triggered the universe's expansion 13.7 billion years ago. These particles were similar to photons, the massless particles that are the basic energy, or quanta, of light. It was in this chaos that extremely large numbers of these particles bonded to each other, according to Caldwell and Guanming Liang, the study's first author and a Dartmouth senior. They theorize that these massless particles were pulled together by the opposing directions of their spin, like the attraction between the north and south poles of magnets. As the particles cooled, Caldwell and Liang say, an imbalance in the particles' spins caused their energy to plummet, like steam rapidly cooling into water. The outcome was the cold, heavy particles that scientists think constitute dark matter. \"The most unexpected part of our mathematical model was the energy plummet that bridges the high-density energy and the lumpy low energy,\" Liang says. \"At that stage, it's like these pairs were getting ready to become dark matter,\" Caldwell says. \"This phase transition helps explain the abundance of dark matter we can detect today. It sprang from the high-density cluster of extremely energetic particles that was the early universe.\" The study introduces a theoretical particle that would have initiated the transition to dark matter. But scientists already know that the subatomic particles known as electrons can undergo a similar transition, Caldwell and Liang say. At low temperatures, two electrons can form what are known as Cooper pairs that can conduct electricity without resistance and are the active mechanism in certain superconductors. Caldwell and Liang cite the existence of Cooper pairs as evidence that the massless particles in their theory would have been capable of condensing into dark matter. \"We looked toward superconductivity for clues as to whether a certain interaction could cause energy to drop so suddenly,\" Caldwell says. \"Cooper pairs prove that the mechanism exists.\" The metamorphosis of these particles from the cosmic equivalent of a double espresso into day-old oatmeal explains the vast deficit in the energy density of the current universe compared to its early days, Liang says. Scientists know that density has declined since the Big Bang as the universe's energy expands outward. But Liang and Caldwell's theory also accounts for the increase in the density of mass. \"Structures get their mass due to the density of cold dark matter, but there also has to be a mechanism wherein energy density drops to close to what we see today,\" Liang says. \"The mathematical model of our theory is really beautiful because it's rather simplistic -- you don't need to build a lot of things into the system for it to work,\" he says. \"It builds on concepts and timelines we know exist.\" Their theory suggests that the particle pairs entered a cold, nearly pressureless state as they got slower and heavier. This characteristic would make them stand out on the CMB. The CMB has been studied by several large-scale observational projects and is the current focus of the Simons Observatory in Chile and other experiments such as CMB Stage 4. Existing and future data from these projects could be used to test Caldwell and Liang's theory, the researchers say. \"It's exciting,\" Caldwell says. \"We're presenting a new approach to thinking about and possibly identifying dark matter.\""

However, typical resonators gradually lose energy over time, requiring constant energy input to maintain their function. Nearly a century ago, Nobel laureates John von Neumann and Eugene Wigner proposed a counterintuitive concept: under certain conditions, waves could be trapped indefinitely without any energy leakage. These so-called Bound States in the Continuum (BIC) are like whirlpools that remain in place even as a river flows around them. But for decades, scientists believed this phenomenon could not exist in a compact, single-particle system. Now, the research team has broken this long-standing theoretical boundary by successfully realizing BIC in a single particle. Using a system of cylindrical granular particles -- small solid rods made of quartz -- the researchers built a highly tunable mechanical platform. By precisely adjusting how the cylinders touch each other, they could control the way mechanical waves interact at the contact boundaries. Under special alignment, a wave mode became fully confined within a single cylinder without any energy escaping into the surrounding structure. This so-called polarization-protected BIC was not just theoretical -- it was observed in real experiments. Even more remarkably, the system achieved quality factors (Q-factors) over 1,000, a measure of how efficiently a resonator stores energy with minimal loss. What happens when many of these special cylinders are connected in a chain? The team discovered that the trapped wave modes could extend throughout the chain without dispersing -- a phenomenon known as a flat band. \"It's like tossing a stone into a still pond and seeing the ripples remain motionless, vibrating only in place,\" said lead author Dr. Yeongtae Jang. \"Even though the system allows wave motion, the energy doesn't spread -- it stays perfectly confined.\" This behavior is described as a Bound Band in the Continuum (BBIC) and opens new possibilities for energy harvesting, ultra-sensitive sensors, and even advanced communications. \"We have broken a long-standing theoretical boundary,\" said Professor Junsuk Rho, who leads the research. \"While this is still in the fundamental research phase, the implications are significant -- from low-loss energy devices to next-generation sensing and signal technologies.\" This research was supported by the Mid-Career Research Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT, as well as the POSCO-POSTECH-RIST Convergence Research Center."

    "context": "[DOC 2015]\nThe new study was led by experts at Newcastle University and the Met Office and investigated how future climate change may influence compound wind-rain extremes, which are events where extreme wind and rainfall occur simultaneously. The researchers analysed data from climate simulations covering control (1981-2000) and future (2060-2081) periods, to assess potential changes in these extreme events. Their findings show that, as the climate warms, these events are likely to become more severe, with stronger winds and heavier rainfall happening together. These changes are mainly driven by increased rainfall, a thermodynamic response to rising temperatures. Additional contributing factors include a strengthened jet stream and its southward displacement that brings storms through warmer areas leading to further increases in rainfall. Publishing their findings in the journal Weather and Climate Extremes, the scientists show that the increase in intensity could lead to more frequent windstorms coinciding with extreme rainfall and floods, posing challenges to coastal areas susceptible to compound flooding as well as emergency response resources due to larger aggregation of separate impacts to infrastructure such as electricity networks and rail transport networks. Study lead author, Dr Colin Manning, Research Associate at Newcastle University's School of Engineering and Visiting Scientist, Met Office, Hadley Centre, said: \"Our work shows that such compound extremes will occur more frequently as our climate warms and likely bring more severe impacts, and a higher aggregation of separate damages arising from wind and flooding which may stretch emergency response resources. Avoiding the worst of these impacts will require cutting our greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the resilience of our infrastructure.\" The team used a number of methods to analyse compound wind-rain extremes and their future changes. They used an event-based analysis based on the occurrence of an extra-tropical cyclone (ETC) over the UK and Ireland. By linking extreme wind and rainfall events to these systems, the scientists assessed their severity using Wind Severity Index (WSI) and Rainfall Severity Index (RSI). Return periods (RPs) were estimated for both individual and joint extremes, indicating their likelihood, while the team categorised events based on their wind and rainfall characteristics. In addition, the researchers identified local co-occurrences of extreme wind gusts and rainfall to understand their changing intensity contributions in future simulations. Professor Lizzie Kendon, Head of Understanding Climate Change at the Met Office and co-author on the paper, said: \"This work exploits the latest high resolution climate projections for the UK, UKCP Local, where the Met Office weather forecast model has been run to give 100-y long climate projections at km-scale. These are providing new insights into how the UK climate may change at the very local scale, and how changes in weather extremes may be realised over the coming years and decades. This is highlighting the importance of considering compounding effects, including co-occurrences of different hazards, as well as the clustering of extreme events, in fully capturing the potential impacts of climate change.\" This research sets the stage for further investigation into the mechanisms driving compound wind-rain extremes. Future research will need to consider a greater range of climate models to understand if the results are robust across different models. Research is also required to understand and quantify the link between these compound extremes and the resultant impacts which would help stakeholders better understand their risk and choose the most cost-effective adaptations to reduce risks.

These cosmic sediments have frozen the primordial soup from which our solar system emerged -- preserving it just like a time capsule. These rocks help researchers to get to the bottom of the origins of matter and of life on Earth. Working together with British colleagues, Dr. Christian Vollmer from the Institute of Mineralogy at MÃ¼nster University has examined one of these time capsules, and a very special one -- the Winchcombe meteorite. The team of researchers are now the first to demonstrate, to a high degree of precision, the existence of some important nitrogen compounds in this meteorite with amino acids and heterocyclic hydrocarbons -- without applying any chemical treatment, and by using a new type of detector design. The results have been published in the journal Nature Communications . Background The Winchcombe meteorite was observed by a camera network in England in February 2021, and it was collected within just a few days. \"Normally, meteorites are tracked down in the cold and hot deserts on Earth, where the dry climate means that they don't weather very fast, but they do change as a result of humidity,\" says Christian Vollmer. \"If a meteorite fall is observed soon after the event and the meteorite is quickly collected, as was the case in Winchcombe, they are important 'witnesses' for us regarding the birth of our solar system -- which makes them especially interesting for research purposes.\" The origins of life on our planet are still shrouded in mystery, and some researchers assume that the first biologically relevant matter was transported to Earth in meteorites over four billion years ago. This matter includes for example complex organic compounds such as amino acids or hydrocarbons. However, these molecules have only very low concentrations, and the experts generally have to separate them out from the meteorite by using solvents or acids and then enrich them for analytical purposes. Christian Vollmer's team was now the first to be able to demonstrate the existence of these biologically relevant nitrogen compounds in the Winchcombe meteorite without first treating them chemically -- although here too the concentrations of these substances are very low. In their work, the researchers used a modern, high-resolution electron microscope such as is found at only a few locations worldwide. This \"super-microscope\" at the SuperSTEM laboratory in Daresbury in England not only depicts high-carbon compounds at atomic resolution -- it can also analyse the samples chemically by means of a new type of detector. \"Demonstrating the existence of these biologically relevant organic compounds in an untreated meteorite is a significant achievement for research,\" says Vollmer. \"It shows that these building blocks of life can be characterised in these cosmic sediments even without chemical extraction.\" The development is also of great importance because chemical treatment includes the risk of these fragile substances being changed. This is why the analytical methods applied here to solid matter are potentially also valuable for research on small, extraterrestrial specimens brought back to Earth from space missions -- such as the dust particles from asteroids recently brought back by the Japanese Space Agency (Hayabusa2) and NASA (OSIRIS-REx).\n\n[DOC 6932]\nThe recently-published analysis fixes an oversight in the current economic model underpinning global climate policy, toppling previous carbon benchmarks. The results support limiting global warming to 1.7 Â°C, which is in line with significantly faster decarbonisation goals like the Paris Agreement, and far lower than the 2.7Â°C supported under previous models. Accounting for an interconnected world Lead researcher Dr Timothy Neal, a Scientia Senior Lecturer in the School of Economics and also the ICRR, says his analysis uses traditional economic frameworks that weigh immediate transition costs against long term climate damages, but refine a key input. \"Economists have traditionally looked at historical data comparing weather events to economic growth to cost climate damages,\" he says. What they fail to account for, he says, are interruptions to the global supply chains currently buffering economic shocks. \"In a hotter future, we can expect cascading supply chain disruptions triggered by extreme weather events worldwide.\" Dr Neal says the economic case for stronger climate change actions is clear. \"Because these damages haven't been taken into account, prior economic models have inadvertently concluded that even severe climate change wasn't a big problem for the economy -- and it's had profound implications for climate policy.\" The local-only damage models have been used in the economic forecasting that has shaped the major powers' climate policies and played a crucial role in international agreements. No nation immune to climate change harm Dr. Neal says the updated projection should underscore to all nations that they are vulnerable to climate change. \"There's an assumption that some colder countries, like Russia or Canada, will benefit from climate change, but supply chain dependencies mean no country is immune.\" But, Dr. Neal says, there's still work to be done. His research doesn't account for climate adaptation, like human migration, which is politically and logistically complex and not yet fully modelled. \"We continue learning from how we see climate change impacting our economy right now, from rising food prices to insurance costs, and we need to be responsive to new information if we're going to act in our best interest.\""

The study showed ABA helps reinforce waterproofing barriers, reducing water loss from roots and aiding their resilience to hard soils. This insight offers a potential key to engineering crop roots with improved resilience to hard soil conditions. Soil is the foundation of life on land, producing over 90% of all terrestrial food. Yet, this dynamic ecosystem is far from uniform: it presents a constantly changing mosaic of nutrients, water availability, microbial life, and mechanical challenges. Understanding how root cells sense and respond to soil stresses is vital for future-proofing global food security. \"Seeing genes related to nutrient sensing, water response, and biotic stress light up ONLY in soil-grown roots was awe-inspiring\" said first author Mingyuan Zhu of Duke University. \"It was a striking moment that made the complexity of root-soil environment interactions feel vividly real.\" Dr Bipin Pandey from the University of Nottingham's School of Biosciences led the Nottingham research, he said: \"This is the first time such cell-resolution expression tools have been applied to roots grown in soil. Understanding root cell-specific responses in a realistic soil environment will pave the way for engineering crops at the cellular level -- tailored to work without disrupting critical processes in other root tissues. This breakthrough research exemplifies the power of interdisciplinary collaboration and represents a paradigm shift in plant biology -- transforming our ability to study processes in root cells from controlled lab conditions to the much more challenging, but realistic, conditions plants experience in soil. As climate change threatens soil quality and agricultural sustainability, such insights are not just scientifically exciting -- they are essential.\" The study also showed that the activation of plant response systems is not only regulated by genetic or biochemical process, but one that physically changes the plant's material properties on a cellular level. In collaboration with the University of Nottingham's Faculty of Engineering, the team used a new cellular resolution imaging technology called phonon microscopy to map changes in cell wall stiffness for roots grown in stressed and unstressed environments. \"We have discovered this incredible capability for plant roots to effectively 'brace for impact,' by stiffening their cell walls, when grown in soil that has been compacted.\" said Dr Salvatore La Cavera from the University of Nottingham's Faculty of Engineering, \"Plants prepare for extreme conditions almost like humans using sandbags to brace for a storm. By better understanding the material properties of plants we can help engineer plants with enhanced physical attributes that are better suited for our changing environment.\" The study also stands as a heartfelt tribute to the late Professor Philip Benfey, a key collaborator whose visionary ideas and approaches helped shape and launch this project. Professor Malcolm Bennettfrom the University of Nottingham has led this area of research and worked with Professor Benfey and commented: \"Philip was very passionate about this area of research and the innovative techniques being pioneered,\" said. \"We are proud to have helped bring his dream to reality.\""

This tar easily clogs pipelines, damages equipment, and poses environmental risks if released into the atmosphere. For decades, researchers have sought ways to eliminate or neutralize it. Now, a team led by scientists at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences argues that instead of being treated as waste, bio-tar can be converted into \"bio-carbon\" -- a novel material with applications ranging from water purification to clean energy storage. \"Our review highlights how turning bio-tar into bio-carbon not only solves a technical problem for the bioenergy industry, but also opens the door to producing advanced carbon materials with high economic value,\" said senior author Dr. Zonglu Yao. The review examines how chemical reactions inside bio-tar, particularly those involving oxygen-rich compounds like carbonyls and furans, naturally promote polymerization -- processes where small molecules link together to form larger, more stable carbon structures. By carefully adjusting temperature, reaction time, and additives, researchers can harness this process to produce bio-carbon with tailored properties. The resulting material, the authors note, is distinct from ordinary biochar. Bio-carbon typically has higher carbon content, lower ash, and unique structural features that make it especially suited for advanced uses. Early studies suggest that bio-carbon could serve as: Importantly, recent economic and life-cycle assessments suggest that converting bio-tar into bio-carbon can deliver net-positive energy, financial, and environmental benefits. For example, replacing coal with bio-carbon fuels could cut carbon dioxide emissions by hundreds of millions of tons annually, while also generating profits for biomass processing plants. Still, challenges remain. The chemical complexity of bio-tar makes it difficult to fully control the polymerization process, and large-scale production has not yet been achieved. The authors recommend combining laboratory experiments with computer simulations and machine learning to optimize reaction pathways and design bio-carbon with specific functions. \"Bio-tar polymerization is not just about waste treatment -- it represents a new frontier for creating sustainable carbon materials,\" said first author Yuxuan Sun. \"With further research, this approach could significantly improve the efficiency of biomass energy systems while providing new tools for environmental protection and clean technology.\" The study provides a roadmap for scientists and industry partners to turn one of bioenergy's biggest obstacles into a powerful resource for the future."

But an unexpected set of circumstances enabled a real-world experiment along the Gulf Coast. An extensive network of nearly 400 monitoring sites was established along the Louisiana coast after hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Then the rate of sea-level rise in the region surged to more than 10 millimeters (half an inch) per year -- at least three times the global average. That exposed the region to the kind of ocean rise not expected until around 2070. The accelerated rise created a unique opportunity to determine whether the marshes can survive that pace of coastal flooding. \"It is the dream of every field researcher who does experiments -- we can basically travel 50 years into the future to get a peek at what's in store,\" said TorbjÃ¶rn TÃ¶rnqvist, Vokes Geology Professor in the Tulane Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. The researchers used new techniques developed by European scientists to measure sea-level rise right off the coast with satellite data, something that was previously not available. The team then compared the rate of water-level rise at each monitoring site with the rate of wetland elevation change determined by other instruments and found that almost 90% of the sites were in deficit. \"To our knowledge, this is the first time that a climate impact experiment has been carried out over a region this large, based on hundreds of monitoring stations that have collected data for about 15 years,\" said Guandong Li, a PhD candidate in Earth and Environmental Sciences at Tulane who led the study. \"This has also allowed us to study the climate impact on a heavily human-influenced landscape, rather than a more resilient pristine ecosystem.\" Li was investigating the role of land subsidence in coastal Louisiana when a team led by SÃ¶nke Dangendorf, the David and Jane Flowerree Professor in Tulane's Department of River-Coastal Science and Engineering, demonstrated the unprecedented rates of sea-level rise along the Gulf and Southeast U.S. coasts since 2010. \"Guandong immediately dropped everything he was working on to take advantage of this unique opportunity,\" TÃ¶rnqvist said. \"He set out to answer the key question of whether coastal marshes can keep up with this rate of sea-level rise, as some earlier modeling studies had suggested they can.\" If the current climate scenario persists, the rate of sea-level rise by 2070 is expected to be about 7 millimeters (one quarter inch) per year. The study projects that approximately 75% of wetland sites will be in deficit by that time, potentially resulting in a rate of wetland loss much higher than what has already occurred in the past century. However, the researchers emphasize that there is hope for a more favorable outcome if immediate action is taken. By meeting the targets set by the Paris Agreement and reducing carbon emissions, it is possible to shift to a more sustainable climate trajectory that would reduce the rate of wetland loss.

And if farmers can't adequately control weeds with PRE or POST herbicides, corn and soybean yields -- and global food security -- will suffer. \"Weather doesn't just matter in the hours after POST application, as other studies have shown. Our analysis showed air temperature and precipitation were linked with herbicide effectiveness days before and after application for the products and weeds we studied,\" said Chris Landau, postdoctoral researcher for USDA-ARS and first author on the paper. \"With the sheer amount of data we analyzed -- thousands and thousands of data points, including a broad range of weather conditions over 30 years -- we were able to characterize the effects of weather on POST herbicide efficacy on a much broader range of environments than previous studies.\" The analysis showed average air temperatures below 66 or above 77 degrees Fahrenheit made fomesafen, glyphosate, and mesotrione -- representing three herbicide sites of action -- less effective on waterhemp, giant foxtail, and morning-glory species. The historical dataset couldn't explain why weeds were less responsive to the herbicides under these conditions, but other studies provide clues. \"If it's excessively warm before application -- and water is not limiting -- weed growth speeds up, resulting in larger plants that may have a better chance of surviving the herbicide,\" said co-author Marty Williams, an ecologist with USDA-ARS and affiliate professor in the Department of Crop Sciences, part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences at Illinois. \"Likewise, a hot period after application could supercharge plant metabolism and neutralize the herbicide faster, rendering it less effective.\" Cold temperatures have essentially the opposite effect, slowing metabolism and movement of herbicides within the plant and rendering them less effective. Herbicide applicators don't just need to pay attention to air temperature, however. The analysis found precipitation patterns -- particularly dry conditions in the 10 days before application or wet conditions 10 days after application -- also affected herbicide effectiveness. Again, Landau points to previous research to explain why dry or rainy conditions might prime weeds to be less responsive to herbicides. For example, drought prompts plants to thicken the waxy cuticle layer on leaf surfaces. That helps plants avoid water loss, but it also makes it harder for foliar-applied herbicides to get in. Wet conditions could not only wash herbicides off leaf surfaces in the hours after application; excess precipitation in the days after application could trigger stress responses, leading to slower growth and reduced movement of herbicides to target sites within the plant. \"Farmers are already dealing with serious challenges due to climate change, such as spring flooding and summer droughts. When you consider that the tools used to combat weeds are also affected by these weather patterns, farming becomes that much more difficult,\" Williams said. While much of the analysis focused on the effects of single herbicides, the team also analyzed the combination of glyphosate and fomesafen. Weed control was more robust with the combined application across variable weather conditions, but the researchers warn that POST combinations alone won't guarantee full control. Landau recommends layering in effective soil-applied residual herbicides and non-chemical tactics to provide more consistent weed control. Williams adds that weed science as a discipline needs to invest in new tools. \"Collectively, weeds are adapting quicker than our ways to manage them. Climate change appears poised to put this evolution on a faster track,\" he said. \"We hope it's possible to get ahead of the issue of failing weed control on the research and development side, because the cost of waiting until everything fails could be painful.\""

The technique is often used as a straightforward way to visualize flood impact in coastal areas but, according to the authors, can lead to an oversimplified and less realistic picture of flood risk than more advanced methods. The alternative to bathtub modeling, they say, is dynamical modeling that solves physics-based equations. \"Bathtub models can both overpredict and underpredict flooding,\" said co-author Brett Sanders, UC Irvine Chancellor's Professor of civil & environmental engineering. \"One of the biggest causes of error is that bathtub models fail to accurately account for the systems in place to protect people and assets, including storm drains, levees and pumping.\" He and his collaborators -- Oliver Wing, chief scientific officer at Fathom and an honorary research fellow at the University of Bristol; and Paul Bates, a University of Bristol professor of hydrology and Fathom chairman -- note that bathtub modeling is limited in its ability to account for at least six key factors (see graphic). Those are: flood attenuation from the effects of event dynamics and friction on flood spreading; tidal amplification associated with the resonance of ocean tides within coastal embayments; flood defenses such as levees and floodwalls that may overtop during an extreme event but still restrain the degree of inland flooding; shoaling of the groundwater table; surfacing groundwater from the combined influence of rising sea levels and changing hydrologic budgets; and pumping of groundwater within lands below sea level to mitigate inundation by rising groundwater. Based on a review of literature pertaining to flood risk, the research team summarizes the reduced accuracy of bathtub models using the critical success index, which scores flood extent accuracy between 0 and 1, where 1 represents a perfect match based on field measurements. The CSI for bathtub models analyzed in the literature is consistently under 0.5, well below the threshold of 0.65 that experts suggest models need in order to have local relevance and therefore produce useful results when applied in impact analyses. \"CSIs under 0.5 indicate that these models are worse than a random classification,\" Wing said. \"In other words, a chimpanzee has more skill than a bathtub model in delineating flood hazard areas.\" Studies that rely on bathtub modeling are frequently found in short-format, high-impact journal publications and attract considerable interest from the news media, according to the researchers. While the biases and uncertainties of bathtub modeling are often acknowledged in these technical papers, the message communicated to the public and policymakers -- sometimes with compelling visualizations of cities under water -- is too often an exaggeration, they say. \"Accurate maps of areas at risk of flooding are of paramount importance for everyone from home and business owners to insurers, banks and governments,\" Bates said. \"We all have a role to play in reducing flood losses, but it all starts with trustworthy information.\" Reliable models of flood risk are needed to effectively engage impacted communities in adaptation processes and to implement effective and equitable mitigation and adaptation strategies, according to Sanders. Inaccurate models could lead to maladaptation. \"Projections of flooding need to make sense to people, not only for building understanding of what's at risk but also for deciding upon the investments and policies that will be made to manage it,\" Sanders said. \"In fact, numerous research papers have shown that residents within at-risk areas are unlikely to trust projections of future flooding if they don't reflect their lived experiences. Research studies that oversimplify flooding and don't represent real-world data pose a threat to transformative action.\" This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Natural Environment Research Council in the U.K."

We need to figure out a way to fix it and make it work.\" Part of what made the Green Revolution so revolutionary was the invention of synthetic, nitrogen-heavy fertilizers that could keep agricultural yields high. But they're expensive to make, they create an enormous amount of carbon dioxide, and much of the fertilizer washes away. Most crops only use about 40-60% of the nitrogen applied to them, a measurement known as nitrogen use efficiency, or NUE, and the NUE of rice can be as low as 30% -- which means that 70% of what a farmer puts on their fields washes away into streams, lakes and the oceans, causing eutrophication, dead zones and a host of other environmental problems. It also means that 70% of the cost of the fertilizer is likewise wasted. Furthermore, when nitrogen is applied to soils, it interacts with the soil's incredibly complex chemistry and microbes, and ultimately leads to vastly increased amounts of methane, ammonia and nitrous oxide -- all of which contribute to global warming. Furthermore, synthesizing fertilizer itself is a greenhouse-gas-heavy enterprise. \"Everybody knows that we need to improve NUE,\" says Xing -- the question is how? What Xing and his co-authors, including lead author Chuanxi Wang and another senior author, Zhenyu Wang, professors of environmental processes and pollution control at Jiangnan University discovered, is that nanoscale selenium, an element crucial for plant and human health, when applied to the foliage and stems of the rice, reduced the negative environmental impacts of nitrogen fertilization by 41% and increased the economic benefits by 38.2% per ton of rice, relative to conventional practices. \"We used an aerial drone to lightly spray rice growing in a paddy with the suspension of nanoscale selenium,\" says Wang. \"That direct contact means that the rice plant is far more efficient at absorbing the selenium than it would be if we applied it to the soil.\" Selenium stimulates the plant's photosynthesis, which increased by more than 40%. Increased photosynthesis means the plant absorbs more CO 2 , which it then turns into carbohydrates. Those carbohydrates flow down into the plant's roots, which causes them to grow. Bigger, healthier roots release a host of organic compounds that cultivate beneficial microbes in the soil, and it's these microbes that then work symbiotically with the rice roots to pull more nitrogen and ammonium out of the soil and into the plant, increasing its NUE from 30 to 48.3%, decreasing the amount of nitrous oxide and ammonia release to the atmosphere by 18.8-45.6%. With more nutrients coming in, the rice itself produces a higher yield, with a more nutritious grain: levels of protein, certain critical amino acids, and selenium also jumped. On top of all of this, Xing, Wang and their colleagues found that their nano-selenium applications allowed farmers to reduce their nitrogen applications by 30%. Since rice cultivation accounts for 15-20% of the global nitrogen use, this new technique holds real promise for helping to meet the triple threat of growing population, climate change, and the rising economic and environmental costs of agriculture."

The researchers analysed data from climate simulations covering control (1981-2000) and future (2060-2081) periods, to assess potential changes in these extreme events. Their findings show that, as the climate warms, these events are likely to become more severe, with stronger winds and heavier rainfall happening together. These changes are mainly driven by increased rainfall, a thermodynamic response to rising temperatures. Additional contributing factors include a strengthened jet stream and its southward displacement that brings storms through warmer areas leading to further increases in rainfall. Publishing their findings in the journal Weather and Climate Extremes, the scientists show that the increase in intensity could lead to more frequent windstorms coinciding with extreme rainfall and floods, posing challenges to coastal areas susceptible to compound flooding as well as emergency response resources due to larger aggregation of separate impacts to infrastructure such as electricity networks and rail transport networks. Study lead author, Dr Colin Manning, Research Associate at Newcastle University's School of Engineering and Visiting Scientist, Met Office, Hadley Centre, said: \"Our work shows that such compound extremes will occur more frequently as our climate warms and likely bring more severe impacts, and a higher aggregation of separate damages arising from wind and flooding which may stretch emergency response resources. Avoiding the worst of these impacts will require cutting our greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the resilience of our infrastructure.\" The team used a number of methods to analyse compound wind-rain extremes and their future changes. They used an event-based analysis based on the occurrence of an extra-tropical cyclone (ETC) over the UK and Ireland. By linking extreme wind and rainfall events to these systems, the scientists assessed their severity using Wind Severity Index (WSI) and Rainfall Severity Index (RSI). Return periods (RPs) were estimated for both individual and joint extremes, indicating their likelihood, while the team categorised events based on their wind and rainfall characteristics. In addition, the researchers identified local co-occurrences of extreme wind gusts and rainfall to understand their changing intensity contributions in future simulations. Professor Lizzie Kendon, Head of Understanding Climate Change at the Met Office and co-author on the paper, said: \"This work exploits the latest high resolution climate projections for the UK, UKCP Local, where the Met Office weather forecast model has been run to give 100-y long climate projections at km-scale. These are providing new insights into how the UK climate may change at the very local scale, and how changes in weather extremes may be realised over the coming years and decades. This is highlighting the importance of considering compounding effects, including co-occurrences of different hazards, as well as the clustering of extreme events, in fully capturing the potential impacts of climate change.\" This research sets the stage for further investigation into the mechanisms driving compound wind-rain extremes. Future research will need to consider a greater range of climate models to understand if the results are robust across different models. Research is also required to understand and quantify the link between these compound extremes and the resultant impacts which would help stakeholders better understand their risk and choose the most cost-effective adaptations to reduce risks.

These conditions limit the opportunities. Now, a new study led by UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain has found that that climate change is further reducing the overall number of days and changing the times of year when prescribed fires can be safely used. Currently, scientists project warming of 2.0 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2060 -- a projection Swain called \"optimistic\" given the current trajectory of even greater warming. Still, these temperatures would reduce the number of days when weather and vegetation conditions favor prescribed fires by 17% on average across the Western U.S. Most reductions would come in spring and summer, when most prescribed burns are currently implemented. Yet in winter, the research projects a net 4% increase in the number of favorable days for prescribed fire. Paper co-author Kristen Shive, a UC Berkeley expert on forests, wildfires and prescribed fire, said specific burn prescriptions vary by location and vegetation type, but target temperatures commonly range from 50-70 degrees Fahrenheit with 10-20% relative humidity. Climate change will require the agencies responsible for prescribed burns to adjust, Swain said, because most personnel who prepare for and manage prescribed fires are seasonal workers whose jobs end by mid-autumn each year. Going forward, the use of prescribed fires will require changes in staff availability. \"Global warming will reduce the number of favorable days for prescribed fires throughout the American West, but winter in particular may emerge as an increasingly favorable time for prescribed burns if the relevant policy and staffing changes can be made,\" Swain said. The researchers also found regional variation in the changes. In California, for example, the changes are most pronounced in coastal and southern parts of the state, with many places losing a month of days suitable for prescribed fires each year. The northern parts of the Rocky Mountains, on the other hand, may see a modest increase in days when it's safe to use these fires. Yet not much will change in the short term, according to Swain. \"We're just not doing a lot of prescribed fire compared to what is needed, at scale, to really address the escalating wildfire crisis,\" he said. The study, published in Communications Earth and Environment , a Nature journal, included research from UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Merced and the Nature Conservancy. It focused on historical and projected climate conditions and vegetation dryness, comparing 1980-2020 with 2020-2060. The researchers did not address other factors important to the use of prescribed fire: impact on ecology, public policy considerations, effects of smoke on humans and wildlife, and availability of staff to do prescribed burns. As wildfires in the American West have dramatically increased for a variety of reasons -- including climate change, human development in fire-prone areas and aggressive fire suppression in the 20th century -- tools like prescribed fires will only become more critical. Anticipating future opportunities and limitations to the use of this tool enables agencies to plan ahead, particularly as regards the firefighting work force. \"This paper is giving us advanced warning,\" Shive said. \"Hopefully we can change policies to either extend those folks or create winter-specific crews.\""

A new study led by researchers at the University of Portsmouth, in partnership with Dhaka University and Curtin University, sheds light on how rising oceans are pushing saltwater into freshwater rivers and underground water sources in the world's largest river mouth -- the Bengal Delta in Bangladesh. Drawing on nearly two decades of data from over 50 monitoring stations in coastal Bangladesh, the team tracked a consistent rise in salt levels in rivers and estuaries, particularly since the mid-2000s. The western parts of the delta, already more prone to tidal influence, showed the fastest increases in salinity. The data suggests that the combination of sea-level rise, reduced freshwater flow, and increasingly frequent storm surges are all contributing to the inland movement and retention of saltwater. Since around 2007, many parts of the delta have experienced stepwise increases in salinity, often linked to powerful storms like Cyclone Sidr. These changes can devastate crops, erode food security, and force communities to move. While the analysis focused primarily on environmental data, it underscores how salinity intrusion is increasingly a threat to livelihoods, public health, and regional stability. The study, published in Ecological Indicators , uses one of the most detailed and long-running salinity datasets in any delta system worldwide. It applied advanced statistical methods to distinguish long-term trends from short-term weather or seasonal changes. The researchers introduced a new conceptual model called the Offshore Controlled Estuarine and Aquifer Nexus (OCEAN) framework, that highlights how offshore features like steep underwater slopes and restricted tidal flows can trap salt in low-lying coastal zones. Dr Mohammad Hoque from the University of Portsmouth's School of the Environment and Life Sciences: said: \"What we're seeing in the Bengal Delta is not just a local crisis, it's a signal of what's coming for low-lying coastal areas around the world. \"Salinity is rising faster and reaching farther inland than many people realise, and it's happening quietly with major consequences for water security, agriculture, and livelihoods. This study helps us understand the mechanics behind it, and underscores the urgency for coordinated, global action.\" The findings also show the limits of relying only on land-based solutions. Human interventions like embankments, riverbed alterations, and upstream dams have often made things worse by restricting freshwater flows. Meanwhile, offshore dynamics -- such as sediment build-up and ocean current shifts -- play a larger role than previously appreciated. Addressing the problem, therefore, requires integrated approaches that connect rivers, oceans, and climate systems. Coastal regions in California, including Los Angeles County and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, are combating saltwater intrusion through innovative measures. In LA, freshwater is injected into aquifers to create hydraulic barriers against seawater. However, population growth and groundwater extraction continue to challenge these efforts. \"While the focus is on Bangladesh, the study's implications are global,\" said Dr Sean Feist, former PhD researcher at the University of Portsmouth and now Scientific Officer at Test Valley Borough Council. \"Coastal regions from the Mekong Delta in Vietnam to Louisiana's wetlands in the United States face similar pressures. As sea levels continue to rise, the risk of agricultural land turning salty, drinking water becoming undrinkable, and shallow groundwater becoming permanently brackish grows ever more serious.\" The paper recommends that similar long-term investigations into changing salinity levels be conducted in other vulnerable coastal regions around the world, particularly in low-lying deltas facing rising seas, reduced river flows, and increasing storm activity. Short-term datasets can often misrepresent the scale or pace of salinisation, while extended records offer a clearer picture of how saltwater intrusion evolves over time. Dr Ashraf Dewan from Curtin University said: \"Ultimately, this study highlights that the creeping salinisation of deltas is a slow-moving but deeply disruptive force. Without urgent investment in salt-tolerant agriculture, better water storage, and strategic planning across entire river basins, the disruptive impacts of salinity are likely to intensify. The Bengal Delta is on the frontline of climate change, but it is not alone. The patterns observed here are emerging in many of the world's great coastal regions. What happens next depends on how quickly we respond.\""

    "context": "[DOC 99]\nBut a new study from Cornell University finds that most regenerative farming practices to build soil organic carbon -- such as planting cover crops, leaving stems and leaves on the ground and not tilling -- actually reduce yields in many situations. The computer model analysis showed that global adoption of such practices to improve soil health can benefit either greenhouse gas mitigation or crop yields but rarely both. The predictions will help farmers, policymakers and sustainability professionals mix and match optimal management plans based on location, as different practices will work better or worse depending on local conditions. For example, the model predicted that climate mitigation and improved yields had the best chance of occurring together when grains are planted, especially in soils with high clay content or that have limited nutrients. \"For the first time, we can have contextualized information about how farmers can choose the optimal mix of practices that meet their needs to maintain crop yields while also providing climate change mitigation,\" said Dominic Woolf, senior research associate in the School of Integrative Plant Science, Soil and Crop Sciences Section, in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University. Woolf is principal investigator of the project and senior author of the study published May 19 in Nature Climate Change. Shelby McClelland, a postdoctoral researcher at New York University's Department of Environmental Studies, formerly in Woolf's lab at Cornell, is the paper's first author. For farmers, climate mitigation strategies include cover crops that are planted and left in place. Cover crops benefit farms by adding soil organic carbon (carbon from organic matter in soils), improving soil health, reducing soil erosion, cycling nutrients and converting nitrogen to forms usable by plants (when legumes are planted). They also offer off-farm benefits of protecting surface water quality and mitigating climate change, by pulling carbon from the air for growing steams, leaves and roots, and sequestering it from being released back into the atmosphere. Other practices, such as eliminating tillage, reduce erosion, limit soil carbon losses and disruption of soil structure. The global computer model compared soil organic carbon changes, greenhouse gas release and yield outcomes of cropland climate mitigation practices with conventional cropland management. The researchers simulated a set of scenarios through the end of the century, including various combinations of four common management practices: planting grass cover crops, planting legume cover crops, zero-tillage, and leaving crop residues in fields. The analysis showed that grass cover crops combined with no tilling led to the highest potential for limiting greenhouse gasses, but were the worst for crop yields. Legume cover crops with no tilling provided higher crop yields but close to 70% lower climate benefits. Reduced yields were found to be most likely in drier climates where cover crops compete for available water. Also, in some regions, these climate mitigation practices led to higher greenhouse gas emissions than conventional farming due to increased soil nitrous oxide, which is 273 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO 2 . \"We found a strong synergy in many locations between cover cropping and conducting no till,\" McClelland said. \"If you do both those practices together, in many cases, that allows you to increase soil organic carbon much faster than individual practices alone, which offsets negative effects from things like nitrous oxide emissions,\" she said. Lowering nitrogen inputs into soil may also help address nitrous oxide emissions. The authors found that in order to maintain crop yields to feed a growing global population, the maximum greenhouse gas mitigation through 2100 would be about 85% lower than if yields were not considered and farming practices centered around optimal climate mitigation strategies. \"So tradeoffs have a massive impact in terms of what's achievable at the global scale,\" Woolf said. Co-authors include researchers from The Nature Conservancy, the Environmental Defense Fund, Colorado State University, and the Woodwell Climate Research Center.

    "context": "[DOC 7548]\nResearchers from the University of California, Riverside show that only one explanation fits both observed ocean temperatures and salinity patterns: the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, is slowing down. This massive current system helps regulate climate by moving warm, salty water northward and cooler water southward at depth. \"People have been asking why this cold spot exists,\" said UCR climate scientist Wei Liu, who led the study with doctoral student Kai-Yuan Li. \"We found the most likely answer is a weakening AMOC.\" The AMOC acts like a giant conveyor belt, delivering heat and salt from the tropics to the North Atlantic. A slowdown in this system means less warm, salty water reaches the sub-polar region, resulting in the cooling and freshening observed south of Greenland. When the current slows, less heat and salt reach the North Atlantic, leading to cooler, fresher surface waters. This is why salinity and temperature data can be used to understand the strength of the AMOC. Liu and Li analyzed a century's worth of this data, as direct AMOC observations go back only about 20 years. From these long-term records, they reconstructed changes in the circulation system and compared those with nearly 100 different climate models. As the paper published in Communications Earth & Environment shows, only the models simulating a weakened AMOC matched the real-world data. Models that assumed a stronger circulation didn't come close. \"It's a very robust correlation,\" Li said. \"If you look at the observations and compare them with all the simulations, only the weakened-AMOC scenario reproduces the cooling in this one region.\" The study also found that the weakening of the AMOC correlates with decreased salinity. This is another clear sign that less warm, salty water is being transported northward. The consequences are broad. The South Greenland anomaly matters not just because it's unusual, but because it's one of the most sensitive regions to changes in ocean circulation. It affects weather patterns across Europe, altering rainfall and shifting the jet stream, which is a high-altitude air current that steers weather systems and helps regulate temperatures across North America and Europe. The slowdown may also disturb marine ecosystems, as changes in salinity and temperature influence where species can live. This result may help settle a dispute amongst climate modelers about whether the South Greenland cooling is driven primarily by ocean dynamics or by atmospheric factors such as aerosol pollution. Many newer models suggested the latter, predicting a strengthened AMOC due to declining aerosol emissions. But those models failed to recreate the actual, observed cooling. \"Our results show that only the models with a weakening AMOC get it right,\" Liu said. \"That means many of the recent models are too sensitive to aerosol changes, and less accurate for this region.\" By resolving that mismatch, the study strengthens future climate forecasts, especially those concerning Europe, where the influence of the AMOC is most pronounced. The study also highlights the ability to draw clear conclusions from indirect evidence. With limited direct data on the AMOC, temperature and salinity records provide a valuable alternative for detecting long-term change, and for helping to predict future climate scenarios. \"We don't have direct observations going back a century, but the temperature and salinity data let us see the past clearly,\" Li said. \"This work shows the AMOC has been weakening for more than a century, and that trend is likely to continue if greenhouse gases keep rising.\" As the climate system shifts, the South Greenland cold spot may grow in influence. The hope is that by unlocking its origins, scientists can better prepare societies for what lies ahead. \"The technique we used is a powerful way to understand how the system has changed, and where it is likely headed if greenhouse gases keep rising,\" Li said."

Still, challenges remain. The chemical complexity of bio-tar makes it difficult to fully control the polymerization process, and large-scale production has not yet been achieved. The authors recommend combining laboratory experiments with computer simulations and machine learning to optimize reaction pathways and design bio-carbon with specific functions. \"Bio-tar polymerization is not just about waste treatment -- it represents a new frontier for creating sustainable carbon materials,\" said first author Yuxuan Sun. \"With further research, this approach could significantly improve the efficiency of biomass energy systems while providing new tools for environmental protection and clean technology.\" The study provides a roadmap for scientists and industry partners to turn one of bioenergy's biggest obstacles into a powerful resource for the future."

These conditions limit the opportunities. Now, a new study led by UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain has found that that climate change is further reducing the overall number of days and changing the times of year when prescribed fires can be safely used. Currently, scientists project warming of 2.0 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2060 -- a projection Swain called \"optimistic\" given the current trajectory of even greater warming. Still, these temperatures would reduce the number of days when weather and vegetation conditions favor prescribed fires by 17% on average across the Western U.S. Most reductions would come in spring and summer, when most prescribed burns are currently implemented. Yet in winter, the research projects a net 4% increase in the number of favorable days for prescribed fire. Paper co-author Kristen Shive, a UC Berkeley expert on forests, wildfires and prescribed fire, said specific burn prescriptions vary by location and vegetation type, but target temperatures commonly range from 50-70 degrees Fahrenheit with 10-20% relative humidity. Climate change will require the agencies responsible for prescribed burns to adjust, Swain said, because most personnel who prepare for and manage prescribed fires are seasonal workers whose jobs end by mid-autumn each year. Going forward, the use of prescribed fires will require changes in staff availability. \"Global warming will reduce the number of favorable days for prescribed fires throughout the American West, but winter in particular may emerge as an increasingly favorable time for prescribed burns if the relevant policy and staffing changes can be made,\" Swain said. The researchers also found regional variation in the changes. In California, for example, the changes are most pronounced in coastal and southern parts of the state, with many places losing a month of days suitable for prescribed fires each year. The northern parts of the Rocky Mountains, on the other hand, may see a modest increase in days when it's safe to use these fires. Yet not much will change in the short term, according to Swain. \"We're just not doing a lot of prescribed fire compared to what is needed, at scale, to really address the escalating wildfire crisis,\" he said. The study, published in Communications Earth and Environment , a Nature journal, included research from UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Merced and the Nature Conservancy. It focused on historical and projected climate conditions and vegetation dryness, comparing 1980-2020 with 2020-2060. The researchers did not address other factors important to the use of prescribed fire: impact on ecology, public policy considerations, effects of smoke on humans and wildlife, and availability of staff to do prescribed burns. As wildfires in the American West have dramatically increased for a variety of reasons -- including climate change, human development in fire-prone areas and aggressive fire suppression in the 20th century -- tools like prescribed fires will only become more critical. Anticipating future opportunities and limitations to the use of this tool enables agencies to plan ahead, particularly as regards the firefighting work force. \"This paper is giving us advanced warning,\" Shive said. \"Hopefully we can change policies to either extend those folks or create winter-specific crews.\""

In the study, civil unrest is classified as over 30,000 people in the UK suffering violent injury in one year through events such as demonstrations and violent looting. Just over 40% of the food experts surveyed believe that civil unrest in the UK in the next 10 years was either possible (38%) or more likely than not (3%). Over the next 50 years, this increased to nearly 80% of experts believing civil unrest was either possible (45%), more likely than not (24%), or very likely (10%). The participants were then asked, if disruption to the food system was to cause the unrest, was it likely to be due to not enough food being available overall, or problems with food distribution, preventing it getting to the right places and creating isolated pockets of hunger. They were asked to consider both questions over the two time frames, 10 and 50 years. The results show that 80% of experts believe logistical distribution issues leading to shortages are the most likely food-related cause of civil unrest in the next 10 years. But, considered over a 50-year horizon, they said catastrophic failure resulting in insufficient food to feed the UK population, rather than distribution problems, would be the most likely cause. The 58 experts who took part in the research were then asked to rank the possible causes of food shortages, and the foods most likely to provoke civil unrest. Wheat, bread, pasta and cereal are thought to be the types of food most likely to lead to unrest, while extreme weather -- including storm surges, flooding, snow and drought -- was chosen as the most likely cause of food shortages and food distribution issues over both the 10-year and 50-year time frames. However, rather than one single driver (extreme weather), the food experts felt that a combination of factors -- including ecological collapse, trade restrictions, a financial crash, rogue AI, a new pandemic, and animal or plant pathogens -- was most likely. Currently just under 50% of the UK's food is imported including 80% of fruit, 50% of vegetables, and 20% of beef and poultry, while the UK is almost completely self-sufficient for wheat, barley, lamb, and potatoes. Around 85% of food imports arrive via boat, and once in the UK, 98% of all food is transported by road. The researchers' aim is to highlight the potential vulnerability of the food system and the importance of developing plans to prepare and respond to these risks. They say the food system has been optimised for efficiency rather than resilience and faces major challenges in the future -- from not just climate change, but a combination of factors that increase the level of risk. Professor Sarah Bridle, Chair of Food, Climate and Society at the University of York, said: \"Covid 19, Brexit and the cost of living crisis have shown the UK is already exposed to certain risks. The food system faces significant challenges. We are experiencing an increasing number of extreme weather events, many driven by climate change. It is entirely possible that in the coming decades extreme weather will cause major crop yield failures across multiple breadbaskets. We need a food system designed not just for optimal efficiency, but also for resilience.\" Professor Aled Jones, Director of the Global Sustainability Institute at Anglia Ruskin University, and also lead author, said: \"By mapping out the potential risks, and their possible causes, we hope this report will assist with the preparations needed to avoid a UK food system catastrophe. \"Government agencies as well as business, must explore and fund options to increase the resilience of the food system including ecosystem restoration and management, storage and distribution, working conditions, sustainable farming practices, consumer engagement, as well as tackling food poverty and mitigating climate change. The Covid pandemic saw major disruption to food distribution and consumption from which lessons need to be learnt.\" Sue Newton, GB Food & Beverage Leader at WTW, said: \"In an increasingly connected world it has never been more important for businesses to think beyond single risks and solutions. Governments and businesses need to be ready for multiple scenarios, reactive when the exact situation doesn't unfold as scripted, and aware of the art of the possible. This research supports organisations in understanding the various pathways that might unfold to feed into their risk planning, and build resilience by identifying needs to support prevention, preparedness, response and recovery planning.\""

Living libraries that fight climate change According to Kantar, plant genebanks are essential for protecting the genetic diversity of food crops. These \"living libraries\" store seeds and other genetic material, providing a vital resource for plant breeders working to develop new crop varieties that have a range of traits from drought resistance to disease tolerance. The researchers used sorghum, a grain grown for food, fuel, and livestock feed, to test a new method called environmental genomic selection. It combines DNA data with climate information to predict which plants are best suited for future conditions. \"It can be applied to any crop that has the right data, these include sorghum, barley, cannabis, pepper and dozens of other crops,\" said Kantar. The approach also saves time. Instead of testing thousands of plants in the field, scientists use a smaller, diverse \"mini-core\" group to forecast how crops will perform in different environments. This helps breeders quickly select the best parents for new, climate-resilient varieties. \"This method will help us keep pace with the hotter temperatures and increased risk of flooding from Earth's changing climate and help develop new varieties to ensure food security,\" Kantar said. Researchers discovered that nations with high sorghum use may need genetic resources from other countries to effectively adapt to climate change stressing the value of global teamwork in securing the world's food supply."

    "context": "[DOC 215]\nResearchers at Indiana University and Wuhan University in China have unveiled a groundbreaking chemical process that could streamline the development of pharmaceutical compounds, chemical building blocks that influence how drugs interact with the body. Their study, published in Chem , describes a novel light-driven reaction that efficiently produces tetrahydroisoquinolines , a group of chemicals that play a crucial role in medicinal chemistry. Tetrahydroisoquinolines serve as the foundation for treatments targeting Parkinson's disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders. These compounds are commonly found in medications such as painkillers and drugs for high blood pressure, as well as in natural sources like certain plants and marine organisms. Traditionally, chemists have relied on well-established but limiting methods to synthesize these molecules. The new research, co-authored by Kevin Brown, the James F. Jackson Professor of Chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences at Indiana University Bloomington, and Professors Xiaotian Qi, Wang Wang, and Bodi Zhao of Wuhan University, presents a fundamentally different approach. How It Works: Light as a Chemical Tool Instead of using traditional chemical reactions, scientists harness light to trigger a process called photoinduced energy transfer , wherein light initiates a controlled reaction between sulfonylimines (a type of chemical compound) and alkenes (another type of compound), leading to the creation of tetrahydroisoquinolines -- a type of complex molecule. This method allows for the development of new structural patterns in the molecules, which were previously difficult or impossible to create using other methods, offering a more efficient way to make complex molecules. \"The key innovation in this study is the use of a light-activated catalyst, a special molecule that speeds up the reaction without being used up itself,\" said Professor Brown. \"Traditional methods require high temperatures or strong acids -- like trying to cook food with a blowtorch instead of a stove. These harsh conditions can sometimes create unwanted side reactions, or make the process less useful for certain chemicals. The new process, however, uses molecules that respond to light, and can bypass heating by access new energy states. This makes the reaction cleaner, more efficient, and less likely to create unwanted byproducts.\" Brown and colleagues also found that tiny changes in the location of electrons within the starting materials had a huge impact on how the reaction played out -- akin to if these electrons were puzzle pieces that needed to fit together just right. By tweaking the shapes of these pieces, the scientists made sure that only the desired product was formed, making the process highly selective. This is crucial for making medicines, where even a small mistake in a molecule's structure can turn a helpful drug into something useless or even harmful. Implications for Medicine and Other Industries \"The ability to create a wider range of tetrahydroisoquinoline-based molecules means that medicinal chemists can now explore new drug candidates for treating diseases like Parkinson's, certain types of cancer, and heart conditions,\" noted Professor Qi. \"Right now, some diseases have very few effective treatment options, and this method could help scientists discover new and better drugs more quickly.\" Beyond pharmaceuticals, this research could also impact other industries that rely on fine chemicals. In agriculture, for example, similar chemical reactions could be used to develop more effective pesticides or fertilizers. In materials science, it could help create new synthetic materials with specific properties, such as better durability and longevity and greater resistance to heat for the aerospace, automotive, electronics, and medical industries. The researchers plan to fine-tune the reaction conditions, meaning, they will experiment with different ingredients and settings to make the improve the process further. They also aim to find out if this method can work on even more types of molecules, expanding its usefulness. In addition, they hope to partner with pharmaceutical companies to test whether this technique can be used to produce medicines, potentially leading to new drug discoveries that could make a difference in people's lives. \"This approach gives chemists a powerful new tool,\" said Professor Brown. \"We hope especially it will open the door to the development of new and improved therapies for patients around the world.\" As the field of photochemistry continues to expand, innovations like this may redefine how medicines and essential chemicals are made, paving the way for faster, cleaner, and more efficient production methods."

    "context": "[DOC 272]\nResearchers from over a dozen institutions worldwide have come together to call on the global community to acknowledge the \"biodiversity leak\": the displacement of nature-damaging human activities caused by ringfencing certain areas for protection or restoration. They argue that rewilding productive farmland or forestry in industrialised nations that have low levels of biodiversity may do more harm than good on a planetary scale. Exploratory analysis by the team suggests that reclaiming typical UK cropland for nature may be five times more damaging for global biodiversity than the benefit it provides local species, due to the displacement of production to more biodiverse regions. While this \"leakage\" has been known about for decades, it is largely neglected in biodiversity conservation, say the researchers. They argue it undermines actions ranging from establishing new nature reserves to the EU's environmental policies. Writing in the journal Science , the experts point out that even the UN's landmark Global Biodiversity Framework -- aiming for 30% of the world's land and seas to be conserved -- makes no mention of the leakage problem. \"As nations in temperate regions such as Europe conserve more land, the resulting shortfalls in food and wood production will have to be made up somewhere,\" said Prof Andrew Balmford from the University of Cambridge's Department of Zoology. \"Much of this is likely to happen in more biodiverse but often less well-regulated parts of the world, such as Africa and South America. Areas of much greater importance for nature are likely to pay the price for conservation efforts in wealthy nations unless we work to fix this leak.\" \"The first thing we need to do is collectively acknowledge that these leaks exist,\" said co-author Prof Brendan Fisher from the University of Vermont. \"If protesting a logging concession in the US increases demand for pulp from the tropics, then we are unlikely to be helping biodiversity.\" Co-author Dr Ben Balmford of the University of Exeter said: \"This issue demands far greater attention from a sector that seeks to shape how 30% of an ever hungrier and more connected planet is managed.\" 'Leakage' is already a major issue for carbon credits tied to forest preservation, say researchers. But they argue it's a real problem for biodiversity conservation efforts too. While protected areas can slow deforestation inside their borders, there's evidence it can simply shift to neighbouring areas. Production can also be displaced much further. Efforts to protect the Pacific Northwest's old-growth forests resulted in increased logging in other North American regions, for example. Yet a survey of site managers of tropical conservation projects conducted by the Cambridge team found that 37% had not come across the concept of leakage, and less than half of the projects were attempting to curb any displacement damage.* The researchers explored how leakage caused by protected areas could affect global biodiversity by applying real-world food and biodiversity data to two hypothetical conservation projects. They found that rewilding a sizeable area of Brazilian soybean farms would push production to nations such as Argentina and USA, but because Brazil is so important for biodiversity, the local conservation gains could be around five times greater than the displacement harms. The opposite would be true if the equivalent area of UK arable farmland was reclaimed for nature. Here, production would be displaced to Australia, Germany, Italy and Ukraine.** As the UK has fewer species than these other countries, damage from 'leakage' could be five times greater than the local benefit to British biodiversity. The experts offer a number of ways to help plug the biodiversity leak. They call on governments and the conservation sector to take leakage far more seriously when making environmental policy at national and global level. They also point out that leakage could be reduced if conservation projects work with others to reduce demand -- especially for high-footprint commodities such as red meat. There's scope to limit leakage by targeting conservation to areas high in biodiversity but where current or potential production of food or timber is limited, say researchers. One example is restoring abandoned tropical shrimp farms to mangroves. However, we should also be much more cautious about restoring natural habitats on currently productive farmland in less biodiverse parts of the world, they argue. Beyond planning where to conserve, major conservation initiatives should work with partners in other sectors to support local farmers, so that overall levels of production are maintained in the region despite protected areas. The team cite examples ranging from forest-friendly chocolate to herding practices that protect snow leopards. Where local yield increases are difficult, larger-scale programmes could establish long-range partnerships with suppliers in the same markets to make up shortfalls in production. \"Without attention and action, there is a real risk that the biodiversity leak will undermine hard-won conservation victories,\" said co-author Dr Fiona Sanderson from the Royal Society for Protection of Birds, who works on reducing the impacts of cocoa production in Sierra Leone. Lead author from Cambridge, Prof Andrew Balmford, added: \"At its worst, we could see some conservation actions cause net global harm by displacing production to regions which are much more significant for biodiversity.\" Notes *Survey of 100 practitioners involved in area-based tropical conservation projects, including directors, managers, coordinators, and researchers. Respondents came from 36 countries across all five continents. ** Two hypothetical habitat restoration programs covering 1000km2 of Brazilian soy-producing land, and restoring 1000km2 of arable farmland in the UK that produces wheat, barley and oilseed rape."

These conditions limit the opportunities. Now, a new study led by UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain has found that that climate change is further reducing the overall number of days and changing the times of year when prescribed fires can be safely used. Currently, scientists project warming of 2.0 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2060 -- a projection Swain called \"optimistic\" given the current trajectory of even greater warming. Still, these temperatures would reduce the number of days when weather and vegetation conditions favor prescribed fires by 17% on average across the Western U.S. Most reductions would come in spring and summer, when most prescribed burns are currently implemented. Yet in winter, the research projects a net 4% increase in the number of favorable days for prescribed fire. Paper co-author Kristen Shive, a UC Berkeley expert on forests, wildfires and prescribed fire, said specific burn prescriptions vary by location and vegetation type, but target temperatures commonly range from 50-70 degrees Fahrenheit with 10-20% relative humidity. Climate change will require the agencies responsible for prescribed burns to adjust, Swain said, because most personnel who prepare for and manage prescribed fires are seasonal workers whose jobs end by mid-autumn each year. Going forward, the use of prescribed fires will require changes in staff availability. \"Global warming will reduce the number of favorable days for prescribed fires throughout the American West, but winter in particular may emerge as an increasingly favorable time for prescribed burns if the relevant policy and staffing changes can be made,\" Swain said. The researchers also found regional variation in the changes. In California, for example, the changes are most pronounced in coastal and southern parts of the state, with many places losing a month of days suitable for prescribed fires each year. The northern parts of the Rocky Mountains, on the other hand, may see a modest increase in days when it's safe to use these fires. Yet not much will change in the short term, according to Swain. \"We're just not doing a lot of prescribed fire compared to what is needed, at scale, to really address the escalating wildfire crisis,\" he said. The study, published in Communications Earth and Environment , a Nature journal, included research from UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Merced and the Nature Conservancy. It focused on historical and projected climate conditions and vegetation dryness, comparing 1980-2020 with 2020-2060. The researchers did not address other factors important to the use of prescribed fire: impact on ecology, public policy considerations, effects of smoke on humans and wildlife, and availability of staff to do prescribed burns. As wildfires in the American West have dramatically increased for a variety of reasons -- including climate change, human development in fire-prone areas and aggressive fire suppression in the 20th century -- tools like prescribed fires will only become more critical. Anticipating future opportunities and limitations to the use of this tool enables agencies to plan ahead, particularly as regards the firefighting work force. \"This paper is giving us advanced warning,\" Shive said. \"Hopefully we can change policies to either extend those folks or create winter-specific crews.\""

    "context": "[DOC 66]\nA new study published in Communications Earth and Environment by UC Merced professors Adeyemi Adebiyi and John Abatzoglou finds that the Central Valley accounts for about 77% of fallowed land in California and is associated with about 88% of major anthropogenic, or human-caused, dust events. \"Idled farmland and dust are particularly concentrated in Kern, Fresno and Kings counties, where annual crops such as wheat, corn, and cotton are fallowed as part of agricultural practices or a combination of water and economic decisions,\" said Abatzoglou, a climatologist in the Department of Management of Complex Systems in the School of Engineering. \"When fields are unplanted, wind erosion can create dust.\" Dust can be laced with chemicals and pathogens that cause severe respiratory illnesses or death. For example, Valley fever, caused by a fungus, relies on dust to spread. Particulate matter has also been linked to various forms of dementia, cardiovascular problems, COPD, asthma, and perhaps surprisingly, longer and more painful menstrual cycles. Vulnerable groups disproportionately bear these health impacts. In addition to health problems, a significant reduction in visibility during dust storms has resulted in fatal traffic accidents. Dust storms can also reduce agricultural productivity due to the loss of fertile topsoil and abrasion of crops by airborne particles, which is particularly critical given the state's role as the leading agricultural producer in the United States. \"California, particularly the Central Valley, has not been considered an important dust source,\" said Adebiyi, who studies dust and its impacts as a member of the Department of Life and Environmental Sciences in the School of Natural Sciences and as an affiliate of the Health Sciences Research Institute. \"However, we're beginning to see, with recent events, that the Central Valley is a major contributor, and much of its dust comes from agricultural sources.\" Although researchers don't fully understand dust's effects on climate, they do know that when dust settles on the Sierra Nevada snowpack, it darkens the snow and encourages melting earlier in the year than usual. That impacts critical water resources for people around the state. Fallowed acreage varies year to year, but the researchers found that the geographic coverage of these unfarmed lands expanded between 2008 and 2022, and that growth could be linked to an increase in dust activities. Although it is common to rotate crops and idle lands regularly, the expansion of unplanted lands is partly due to the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, which requires farmers to limit the water they use yearly. \"The goal of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act is clearly to balance groundwater, which is important for California's future,\" Adebiyi said. \"However, there are unintended consequences to nearby communities, such as potential dust that comes from farmland fallowed due to SGMA, and what is crucial are those mitigation efforts that can reduce wind erosion.\" The researchers suggested farmers consider cover crops or ground cover that increases soil health and reduces dust. Widespread dust events are generally driven by weather, such as strong winds or storms, but dust becomes more likely when soil is dry and disturbed, the latter being human-caused, Abatzoglou said. Human activity, including construction and farming, heavily drives localized dust. Continued research, such as this study and another recent one that resulted in a report from a coalition called UC Dust, will help researchers better understand dust's impacts on a wide range of concerns and challenges. \"A better understanding of what likely dominates anthropogenic dust from agricultural sources may help us better represent the overall impacts of dust in other parts of the country and the world,\" Adebiyi said. One of the biggest unknowns in simulating climate and health impacts of dust in the future is how anthropogenic dust may change. \"Because our study points to fallowed or idled farmlands as a dominant contributor, that may change how we estimate overall dust impact,\" he said."

These conditions limit the opportunities. Now, a new study led by UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain has found that that climate change is further reducing the overall number of days and changing the times of year when prescribed fires can be safely used. Currently, scientists project warming of 2.0 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2060 -- a projection Swain called \"optimistic\" given the current trajectory of even greater warming. Still, these temperatures would reduce the number of days when weather and vegetation conditions favor prescribed fires by 17% on average across the Western U.S. Most reductions would come in spring and summer, when most prescribed burns are currently implemented. Yet in winter, the research projects a net 4% increase in the number of favorable days for prescribed fire. Paper co-author Kristen Shive, a UC Berkeley expert on forests, wildfires and prescribed fire, said specific burn prescriptions vary by location and vegetation type, but target temperatures commonly range from 50-70 degrees Fahrenheit with 10-20% relative humidity. Climate change will require the agencies responsible for prescribed burns to adjust, Swain said, because most personnel who prepare for and manage prescribed fires are seasonal workers whose jobs end by mid-autumn each year. Going forward, the use of prescribed fires will require changes in staff availability. \"Global warming will reduce the number of favorable days for prescribed fires throughout the American West, but winter in particular may emerge as an increasingly favorable time for prescribed burns if the relevant policy and staffing changes can be made,\" Swain said. The researchers also found regional variation in the changes. In California, for example, the changes are most pronounced in coastal and southern parts of the state, with many places losing a month of days suitable for prescribed fires each year. The northern parts of the Rocky Mountains, on the other hand, may see a modest increase in days when it's safe to use these fires. Yet not much will change in the short term, according to Swain. \"We're just not doing a lot of prescribed fire compared to what is needed, at scale, to really address the escalating wildfire crisis,\" he said. The study, published in Communications Earth and Environment , a Nature journal, included research from UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Merced and the Nature Conservancy. It focused on historical and projected climate conditions and vegetation dryness, comparing 1980-2020 with 2020-2060. The researchers did not address other factors important to the use of prescribed fire: impact on ecology, public policy considerations, effects of smoke on humans and wildlife, and availability of staff to do prescribed burns. As wildfires in the American West have dramatically increased for a variety of reasons -- including climate change, human development in fire-prone areas and aggressive fire suppression in the 20th century -- tools like prescribed fires will only become more critical. Anticipating future opportunities and limitations to the use of this tool enables agencies to plan ahead, particularly as regards the firefighting work force. \"This paper is giving us advanced warning,\" Shive said. \"Hopefully we can change policies to either extend those folks or create winter-specific crews.\""

Plus, they face more stress than ever before brought on by factors such as renewable energy and by extreme weather events such as hurricanes, heat waves, and winter storms. Case in point -- the 2021 event in Texas that left millions powerless. That is when University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) researchers decided to look inside grid transformers to see if they could make them better. Grid transformers are filled with copper windings, other metallic components, and cellulose-based electrical insulation like kraft paper. The cellulose insulation is a great electrical insulator essential in the process of 'stepping down' voltage, but it also traps heat, which can lead to overheating. \"We've researched a new class of nanomaterials where we take conventional cellulose-based paper and dope it with high thermal conductivity nanometer and micrometer-sized particles,\" said Vaibhav Bahadur, an associate professor in the Cockrell School of Engineering, UT Austin. Bahadur is the corresponding author of a study that modeled the impact of high thermal conductivity paper on the performance and life of grid transformers published March 2024 in Cell Press journal Heliyon . This is the first study that predicts the extent to which tuning the thermal conductivity of paper can enhance transformer life. Simulations on the Stampede2 supercomputer of the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) helped Bahadur and his collaborators engineer solutions to overheat of grid transformers -- a critical component of the electric grid. Collaborators at the University of Maryland and the USDA Forest Products Laboratory fabricated the high thermal conductivity paper using nanoparticles of boron nitride. Bahadur's lab built a 3D model of the transformer to mimic an actual grid transformer taken apart and studied by study co-author Robert Hebner, also in the Cockrell School of Engineering. \"The experimental part of the study was critical in testing whether to invest in improving the transformer installation,\" Hebner said. \"We had a transformer donated to The Center for Electromechanics, which was powered by UT Austin's one megawatt micro grid. We could connect it and run the temperatures up and down, and we could measure how the transformer behaved. The model and the measurements meshed very well,\" Hebner said. \"Our results indicate that if the thermal conductivity is increased by a few times using the engineered paper, the hotspot temperature inside a transformer can be reduced by between 5 to 10 Â°C,\" he added. \"In most conditions that should be enough to double or triple the life of the transformer.\" The Bahadur Research Group was awarded allocations on TACC's Stampede2 supercomputer, a National Science Foundation-funded computational workhorse for UT Austin researchers and thousands of other researchers in the U.S. open science community. \"This model was simulated using TACC resources to predict the thermal performance,\" Bahadur said. \"We modeled the thermal conductivity as a varying parameter, and we figured out the extent of improvement needed in thermal conductivity to see a meaningful temperature reduction.\" The main computational challenge was the shear immensity of modeling the details inside an actual transformer. \"To accurately estimate temperatures, we used a fine-sized mesh based on finite element methods and modeled the conduction through the diffusion heat transfer equation -- the computational costs are high in doing so,\" Bahadur said. \"The main reason we used Stampede2 was to get simulations done in a matter of minutes/hours and not wait for days to get our results.\" Next, the researchers will test a small-scale transformer prototype and add the thermal conducting paper to study how it behaves in an operating environment with fluctuating loads. This research has the possibility to find applications in the real world, where new transformers could be made with improved nano and micro particle enhanced thermal insulating paper. Old transformers could be retrofitted with the new paper during routine refurbishment. \"We started not as a transformer project, but as a semiconductor project. This research aims to take a lot of the electronic devices that we have and make them operate better by operating cooler and more efficiently,\" Hebner added."

While some plants and regions may benefit from some aspects of climate change, without prolonged and costly intervention, many more will suffer potentially catastrophic declines. \"By 2050-60, crops will experience a significantly different environment from today,\" Long writes. From its pre-industrial level of about 200 parts per million, \"atmospheric CO 2 reached 427 ppm in 2024 and is projected to be about 600 ppm by 2050.\" Extreme heat, droughts, floods and other climate-related events are already disrupting agricultural systems. Projected temperature extremes and climate instability will further reduce crop yields, increasing starvation, political unrest and mass migration, he writes. There is some hope, however. It may be possible to alter crops in ways that allow them to persist and perhaps even increase yields despite the challenges, Long said. While the process takes time and can be costly, the work has already begun. For example, researchers are evaluating the heat-, drought- and flood-tolerance of different varieties of specific crop plants, identifying those with potentially beneficial attributes. Discovering the genetic traits that confer these benefits will allow scientists to develop crops -- through plant breeding and/or genetic engineering -- that can better withstand the extremes. Through painstaking work, scientists have discovered that some rice varieties can survive up to two weeks of submergence during periods of intense flooding, while other varieties are more heat tolerant than others. The findings offer opportunities to develop hardier cultivars. Plants must withstand an array of challenges as temperatures rise. The drying capacity of the atmosphere, which increases with temperature, draws moisture out of plant leaves through tiny pores called stomata. This reduces plant water-use efficiency, Long said, straining already scarce water resources in many parts of the globe. \"A plant may partially close its stomata to retain moisture, but this can interfere with its ability to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a key step in photosynthesis,\" Long said. In laboratory and field experiments, researchers found that increasing the expression of the gene for a sensor protein found in plants reduced water loss through stomata without interfering with photosynthesis. \"The result was a 15% improvement in leaf-level water-use efficiency in field-grown tobacco and a 30% decrease in whole plant water use,\" Long wrote. Because of the high speed with which it can be genetically modified, tobacco is often used as a \"test-bed\" for studying alterations that can be used in a variety of other plants. Researchers also have found ways to reduce the density of stomata on the leaves of rice and wheat, improving water-use efficiency by 15-20% with no decrease in yield. High carbon dioxide on its own alters plant physiology, sometimes in beneficial ways by boosting photosynthesis, but also in detrimental ways, Long said. High CO 2 can change plant metabolic control by altering levels of key enzymes. Scientists have found that adjusting the levels of proteins that regulate rubisco, a key photosynthetic enzyme, can boost photosynthetic efficiency in the presence of high CO 2 . To demonstrate what kinds of gains are possible in food crops, Long points to the remarkable progress made in research on maize, nearly 80% of which is used in ethanol production and to feed animals, not humans. \"Between 1980 and 2024, U.S. maize yields doubled while sorghum improved just 12%,\" he said. The success in maize is the result of massive investments from large multinational companies. The same investments are not yet being made on the public domain side of the equation. Without similar investment, \"it is hard to see how the opportunities â€¦ for future-proofing our crops can be implemented at the scale that is necessary,\" he writes. Long also is a professor in the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at the U. of I. He is supported by Gates Agricultural Innovations and the Department of Energy Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation."

    "context": "[DOC 1757]\nThe study, published today and led by experts from the University of Bristol and global water risk intelligence firm Fathom, reveals projections of different types of flooding in various climate change scenarios with unprecedented precision. Through deploying the most comprehensive mapping framework, findings indicate overall global flooding could increase by around half between 2020 and the turn of the century in the event of high climate sensitivity and multilateral promises to reduce carbon emissions being broken. Lead author Dr Oliver Wing, Honorary Research Fellow at the University of Bristol Cabot Institute for the Environment and Chief Research Officer at Fathom, said: \"This research represents the culmination of years of research on our quest to help future-proof communities around the world from the evolving risk of flooding. The findings underscore the vital importance of all countries keeping their promise to cut carbon emissions.\" In the best-case lower emissions scenario, where all global carbon pledges are fulfilled, the average flood hazard level is projected to rise by 9% between 2020 and 2100. The more pessimistic prospect of higher carbon emissions showed flooding could increase 49% by the end of the century. In the next few decades, the projected increases in flood hazard were more modest. Between 2020 and 2050, in a low carbon emissions scenario flood risk is anticipated to grow 7% with this doubling to more than 15% in a high carbon emissions model. Dr Wing said: \"It is important to note that these global averages result from predicted changes in hazard that have large geographical variations. Some places will see their flood risk fall, whilst for others the increases will be many times larger than the global average even under a lower emissions scenario.\" The report highlighted that coastal flooding remains a hotspot regardless of whether all global carbon emissions are met or not. Even in a low emissions scenario, coastal flooding is forecast to almost double, increasing by 99% by 2100, due to the lagged response of ocean sea level rise to existing warming. Flooding caused by rainfall was found to be especially vulnerable to human-induced climate change. Whereas this type of flooding was shown to increase by 6% by 2100 in a low emissions scenario, this increase grows to 44% in a high emissions model. The largest future increases in flooding are projected to be around global coastlines and in tropical Africa and Asia, as well as significant changes to arid North Africa. The likelihood of flood increases was most pronounced along the North Atlantic and Indian Ocean coasts, as well as for southeastern Asia and the Pacific Islands. Recently developed global flood models estimate the national or global population exposed to floods; potential value of assets at risk; cost and benefits of flood defences, and the impact of climate and socio-economic change on future losses. Most only represent river flooding, but this study factors in the significant impact of coastal flooding, and has undergone the most rigorous validation of any global flood model to date. Countries signed up to ambitious pledges to lower carbon emissions at COP27 and the study clearly indicates that if these aren't all achieved on time and in full, flooding levels look set to be heavily impacted. Co-author Professor Paul Bates CBE, Professor of Hydrology at the University of Bristol Cabot Institute for the Environment and Chairman and Co-founder of Fathom, said: \"Undertaking this research project involved subjecting our findings to the most comprehensive benchmarking of global flood modelling yet published. \"With the highest resolution results produced to date, we hope industries will derive value from our model for a range of additional use cases, such as protecting critical infrastructure from future flooding, helping insurers price premiums and meeting the requirements of climate regulations.\" Additional contributors to the research paper from the University of Bristol include Prof Jeff Neal, Professor of Hydrology at the University of Bristol Cabot Institute for the Environment and Chief Scientific Advisor at Fathom; and two Fathom scientists soon to embark on PhDs at the University."

    "context": "[DOC 6905]\nThe researchers argue that previous fairness and ambition assessments were biased, as they start from shifting goalposts of rising emissions. Their proposed method avoids delaying the obligation to reduce emissions and calculates the immediate ambition gap that can be filled by climate measures and international finance. As negotiated climate targets are still insufficient, this work underscores the growing role of courts in ensuring that climate and human rights obligations are met. The study highlights that high-emitting countries, most notably G7 countries, Russia, and China, need to do more given the very different historical responsibility and financial capability of countries. An approach based on historical responsibility needed Fair-share emissions allocations distribute the global carbon budget among countries based on principles like historical responsibility, capability, and development needs, aiming to assign each country a 'fair share' of allowable emissions. Under the Paris Agreement, these allocations indicate what each country should commit to in order to collectively limit global warming to 1.5Â°C and staying well below 2Â°C. By calculating each ambition and fairness assessment from the present situation, we increasingly let major polluting countries off the hook. This pushes a heavier burden onto countries that have done the least to cause the crisis, or more realistically brings the world towards catastrophic levels of global warming. Therefore, the authors propose calculating fair-share emissions allocations immediately based on each country's historical contributions to climate change and their capacity to act. Accounting for immediate responsibilities sets a new baseline. It would cause some countries' emission paths to suddenly and drastically change instead of following a smooth decline. This approach would demand steep, immediate cuts mostly from wealthier, high-emitting countries. Since the cuts needed from these countries are too large to achieve locally, it requires substantial financial support for additional mitigation in poorer countries. Importantly, removing the systemic reward for inaction affects the ranking of countries' gap between their current pledges and fair emissions allocations, even within the group of high-income countries. Then, the USA, Australia, Canada, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have the greatest gap, requiring the most additional effort and finance. Much of equity discussions is about developed versus developing countries, but this paper is particularly relevant for developed countries being rewarded for inaction compared to other and more ambitious developed countries. Role in climate litigation Fair-share studies like this one are increasingly used in climate litigation, such as the KlimaSeniorinnen case before the European Court of Human Rights. The court recognised that insufficient national climate action constitutes a breach of human rights and that countries must justify how their climate pledges are a fair and ambitious contribution to the global objectives. Courts rely on these assessments to evaluate whether national emissions targets are sufficient and equitable. Biases in the assessments therefore have real-world impact: they can shape legal rulings, influence policy commitments, and inform public opinions. Courts are thus emerging as a key force in ensuring accountability and indirectly promoting cooperation when political and diplomatic negotiations fall short. In a landmark advisory opinion issued on July 23, 2025, the International Court of Justice affirmed that countries have a legal obligation under international law to prevent significant harm to the climate system, emphasising the duty to act collectively and urgently. \"This strengthens and underscores the growing role of courts in enforcing climate justice,\" says Robiou du Pont. Paying the debt Solving the climate crisis is a moral imperative long identified by climate justice activists and scholars. Practically, we are observing that the lack of fair efforts by countries with the greatest capacity and responsibility to act and provide finance, results in insufficient action globally. A fairer allocation of effort is likely to results in more ambitious outcomes globally. This study explains how immediate climate efforts and finance are key to align with international agreements to limiting global warming."

These conditions limit the opportunities. Now, a new study led by UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain has found that that climate change is further reducing the overall number of days and changing the times of year when prescribed fires can be safely used. Currently, scientists project warming of 2.0 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2060 -- a projection Swain called \"optimistic\" given the current trajectory of even greater warming. Still, these temperatures would reduce the number of days when weather and vegetation conditions favor prescribed fires by 17% on average across the Western U.S. Most reductions would come in spring and summer, when most prescribed burns are currently implemented. Yet in winter, the research projects a net 4% increase in the number of favorable days for prescribed fire. Paper co-author Kristen Shive, a UC Berkeley expert on forests, wildfires and prescribed fire, said specific burn prescriptions vary by location and vegetation type, but target temperatures commonly range from 50-70 degrees Fahrenheit with 10-20% relative humidity. Climate change will require the agencies responsible for prescribed burns to adjust, Swain said, because most personnel who prepare for and manage prescribed fires are seasonal workers whose jobs end by mid-autumn each year. Going forward, the use of prescribed fires will require changes in staff availability. \"Global warming will reduce the number of favorable days for prescribed fires throughout the American West, but winter in particular may emerge as an increasingly favorable time for prescribed burns if the relevant policy and staffing changes can be made,\" Swain said. The researchers also found regional variation in the changes. In California, for example, the changes are most pronounced in coastal and southern parts of the state, with many places losing a month of days suitable for prescribed fires each year. The northern parts of the Rocky Mountains, on the other hand, may see a modest increase in days when it's safe to use these fires. Yet not much will change in the short term, according to Swain. \"We're just not doing a lot of prescribed fire compared to what is needed, at scale, to really address the escalating wildfire crisis,\" he said. The study, published in Communications Earth and Environment , a Nature journal, included research from UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Merced and the Nature Conservancy. It focused on historical and projected climate conditions and vegetation dryness, comparing 1980-2020 with 2020-2060. The researchers did not address other factors important to the use of prescribed fire: impact on ecology, public policy considerations, effects of smoke on humans and wildlife, and availability of staff to do prescribed burns. As wildfires in the American West have dramatically increased for a variety of reasons -- including climate change, human development in fire-prone areas and aggressive fire suppression in the 20th century -- tools like prescribed fires will only become more critical. Anticipating future opportunities and limitations to the use of this tool enables agencies to plan ahead, particularly as regards the firefighting work force. \"This paper is giving us advanced warning,\" Shive said. \"Hopefully we can change policies to either extend those folks or create winter-specific crews.\""

    "context": "[DOC 1]\n\"The Green Revolution massively boosted agriculture output during the middle of the last century,\" says Baoshan Xing, University Distinguished Professor of Environmental and Soil Chemistry, director of UMass' Stockbridge School of Agriculture, and co-senior author of the new research. \"But that revolution is running out of steam. We need to figure out a way to fix it and make it work.\" Part of what made the Green Revolution so revolutionary was the invention of synthetic, nitrogen-heavy fertilizers that could keep agricultural yields high. But they're expensive to make, they create an enormous amount of carbon dioxide, and much of the fertilizer washes away. Most crops only use about 40-60% of the nitrogen applied to them, a measurement known as nitrogen use efficiency, or NUE, and the NUE of rice can be as low as 30% -- which means that 70% of what a farmer puts on their fields washes away into streams, lakes and the oceans, causing eutrophication, dead zones and a host of other environmental problems. It also means that 70% of the cost of the fertilizer is likewise wasted. Furthermore, when nitrogen is applied to soils, it interacts with the soil's incredibly complex chemistry and microbes, and ultimately leads to vastly increased amounts of methane, ammonia and nitrous oxide -- all of which contribute to global warming. Furthermore, synthesizing fertilizer itself is a greenhouse-gas-heavy enterprise. \"Everybody knows that we need to improve NUE,\" says Xing -- the question is how? What Xing and his co-authors, including lead author Chuanxi Wang and another senior author, Zhenyu Wang, professors of environmental processes and pollution control at Jiangnan University discovered, is that nanoscale selenium, an element crucial for plant and human health, when applied to the foliage and stems of the rice, reduced the negative environmental impacts of nitrogen fertilization by 41% and increased the economic benefits by 38.2% per ton of rice, relative to conventional practices. \"We used an aerial drone to lightly spray rice growing in a paddy with the suspension of nanoscale selenium,\" says Wang. \"That direct contact means that the rice plant is far more efficient at absorbing the selenium than it would be if we applied it to the soil.\" Selenium stimulates the plant's photosynthesis, which increased by more than 40%. Increased photosynthesis means the plant absorbs more CO 2 , which it then turns into carbohydrates. Those carbohydrates flow down into the plant's roots, which causes them to grow. Bigger, healthier roots release a host of organic compounds that cultivate beneficial microbes in the soil, and it's these microbes that then work symbiotically with the rice roots to pull more nitrogen and ammonium out of the soil and into the plant, increasing its NUE from 30 to 48.3%, decreasing the amount of nitrous oxide and ammonia release to the atmosphere by 18.8-45.6%. With more nutrients coming in, the rice itself produces a higher yield, with a more nutritious grain: levels of protein, certain critical amino acids, and selenium also jumped. On top of all of this, Xing, Wang and their colleagues found that their nano-selenium applications allowed farmers to reduce their nitrogen applications by 30%. Since rice cultivation accounts for 15-20% of the global nitrogen use, this new technique holds real promise for helping to meet the triple threat of growing population, climate change, and the rising economic and environmental costs of agriculture."

    "context": "[DOC 7171]\nTo safely carry out controlled burns, firefighters must wait for specific weather conditions: not so damp as to prevent combustion, but not so dry or windy as to burn more vegetation than intended. These conditions limit the opportunities. Now, a new study led by UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain has found that that climate change is further reducing the overall number of days and changing the times of year when prescribed fires can be safely used. Currently, scientists project warming of 2.0 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2060 -- a projection Swain called \"optimistic\" given the current trajectory of even greater warming. Still, these temperatures would reduce the number of days when weather and vegetation conditions favor prescribed fires by 17% on average across the Western U.S. Most reductions would come in spring and summer, when most prescribed burns are currently implemented. Yet in winter, the research projects a net 4% increase in the number of favorable days for prescribed fire. Paper co-author Kristen Shive, a UC Berkeley expert on forests, wildfires and prescribed fire, said specific burn prescriptions vary by location and vegetation type, but target temperatures commonly range from 50-70 degrees Fahrenheit with 10-20% relative humidity. Climate change will require the agencies responsible for prescribed burns to adjust, Swain said, because most personnel who prepare for and manage prescribed fires are seasonal workers whose jobs end by mid-autumn each year. Going forward, the use of prescribed fires will require changes in staff availability. \"Global warming will reduce the number of favorable days for prescribed fires throughout the American West, but winter in particular may emerge as an increasingly favorable time for prescribed burns if the relevant policy and staffing changes can be made,\" Swain said. The researchers also found regional variation in the changes. In California, for example, the changes are most pronounced in coastal and southern parts of the state, with many places losing a month of days suitable for prescribed fires each year. The northern parts of the Rocky Mountains, on the other hand, may see a modest increase in days when it's safe to use these fires. Yet not much will change in the short term, according to Swain. \"We're just not doing a lot of prescribed fire compared to what is needed, at scale, to really address the escalating wildfire crisis,\" he said. The study, published in Communications Earth and Environment , a Nature journal, included research from UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Merced and the Nature Conservancy. It focused on historical and projected climate conditions and vegetation dryness, comparing 1980-2020 with 2020-2060. The researchers did not address other factors important to the use of prescribed fire: impact on ecology, public policy considerations, effects of smoke on humans and wildlife, and availability of staff to do prescribed burns. As wildfires in the American West have dramatically increased for a variety of reasons -- including climate change, human development in fire-prone areas and aggressive fire suppression in the 20th century -- tools like prescribed fires will only become more critical. Anticipating future opportunities and limitations to the use of this tool enables agencies to plan ahead, particularly as regards the firefighting work force. \"This paper is giving us advanced warning,\" Shive said. \"Hopefully we can change policies to either extend those folks or create winter-specific crews.\""

    "answer_gold": "Machine learning can analyze large datasets to detect patterns among rainfall, surge, tide, and river discharge interactions.",
    "answer_pred": "The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of machine learning for predicting compound flooding. However, it does discuss the analysis of compound wind-rain extremes using climate simulations and indices like the Wind Severity Index (WSI) and Rainfall Severity Index (RSI). While machine learning is not directly referenced, it could potentially be used to enhance predictions by analyzing large datasets from climate simulations to identify patterns and correlations between extreme weather events. This could improve the accuracy of predicting the likelihood and severity of compound flooding events. For a more detailed answer, additional context specifically addressing machine learning applications would be needed.",

The researchers analysed data from climate simulations covering control (1981-2000) and future (2060-2081) periods, to assess potential changes in these extreme events. Their findings show that, as the climate warms, these events are likely to become more severe, with stronger winds and heavier rainfall happening together. These changes are mainly driven by increased rainfall, a thermodynamic response to rising temperatures. Additional contributing factors include a strengthened jet stream and its southward displacement that brings storms through warmer areas leading to further increases in rainfall. Publishing their findings in the journal Weather and Climate Extremes, the scientists show that the increase in intensity could lead to more frequent windstorms coinciding with extreme rainfall and floods, posing challenges to coastal areas susceptible to compound flooding as well as emergency response resources due to larger aggregation of separate impacts to infrastructure such as electricity networks and rail transport networks. Study lead author, Dr Colin Manning, Research Associate at Newcastle University's School of Engineering and Visiting Scientist, Met Office, Hadley Centre, said: \"Our work shows that such compound extremes will occur more frequently as our climate warms and likely bring more severe impacts, and a higher aggregation of separate damages arising from wind and flooding which may stretch emergency response resources. Avoiding the worst of these impacts will require cutting our greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the resilience of our infrastructure.\" The team used a number of methods to analyse compound wind-rain extremes and their future changes. They used an event-based analysis based on the occurrence of an extra-tropical cyclone (ETC) over the UK and Ireland. By linking extreme wind and rainfall events to these systems, the scientists assessed their severity using Wind Severity Index (WSI) and Rainfall Severity Index (RSI). Return periods (RPs) were estimated for both individual and joint extremes, indicating their likelihood, while the team categorised events based on their wind and rainfall characteristics.

This is highlighting the importance of considering compounding effects, including co-occurrences of different hazards, as well as the clustering of extreme events, in fully capturing the potential impacts of climate change.\" This research sets the stage for further investigation into the mechanisms driving compound wind-rain extremes. Future research will need to consider a greater range of climate models to understand if the results are robust across different models.
