  },
  {
    "id": "CF_129",
    "question": "How does rapid snowmelt combine with rainfall to cause compound flooding?",
    "answer": "Rapid melting adds discharge to rivers, and when paired with intense rainfall, rivers overflow more easily."
  },
  {
    "id": "CF_130",
    "question": "How do shallow coastal shelves influence flood intensity?",
    "answer": "Shallow shelves allow surge to build higher and push farther inland than deeper shelves."
  },
  {
    "id": "CF_131",
    "question": "Why do compound floods often produce prolonged inundation?",
    "answer": "Slow drainage due to elevated coastal water levels keeps inland floodwaters trapped for extended periods."
  },
  {
    "id": "CF_132",
    "question": "How do strong pressure systems contribute to compound flooding?",
    "answer": "Low pressure elevates water levels while strong winds drive surface water inland, worsening flooding."
  },
  {
    "id": "CF_133",
    "question": "How do storm patterns influence the coincidence of flood drivers?",
    "answer": "Storm patterns dictate the alignment of rainfall peaks, surge timing, and tidal cycles."
  },
  {
    "id": "CF_134",
    "question": "How does channel narrowing affect compound flood dynamics?",
    "answer": "Narrow channels hinder flow and elevate upstream water levels, especially during surge."
  },
  {
    "id": "CF_135",
    "question": "Why do regions with extensive levee systems still face compound flood risk?",
    "answer": "Levees may block surge but cannot prevent inland rainfall accumulation or backflow from rivers."

    "question": "How do multiday storms influence compound flooding?",
    "answer": "Multiday storms produce prolonged rainfall that overlaps with storm surge cycles and high tides."
  },
  {
    "id": "CF_144",
    "question": "How can storm surge accelerate river flooding upstream?",
    "answer": "Surge increases downstream water levels, pushing water up the river and raising upstream flood heights."

  {
    "id": "CF_146",
    "question": "How does tidal locking influence compound flooding?",
    "answer": "Tidal locking occurs when storms slow near coastlines, aligning peak rainfall with tidal highs and increasing flood severity."
